You... By the Nine Hells, who are you? Bah, I care not. You want this trinket? So be it. But I warn you, take it back lest you suffer as I have! Take it back lest you die as I would have! He gets in your head, he does! I disturbed his lonely slumber, so he ruins mine as penance! Return it east lest you pay as well!
