These merchant men are greedy. They want island and ship. May their bones rot in Nine Hells! The merchants want treasures from the New World. The Trackless Sea is very wide, so Merchants' League ships must stop for supplies. They would stop at Evermeet but elf place is north, too much. Only place to stop is Sundrah on Lantan but fees are very expensive. Merchant men lose money too much in Sundrah. The Merchant sailors see more than shipwreck on island. They see big harbor, also. They want to turn this harbor into new stop for ships from Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate.
