Tragic things are happening in this unfair, uh, how you say... world. The men with power, they hurt the men with none. They destroy things that teach us better life. I tell you true, it would be better if these men are not born! This Merchants' League, these bad men, they find the island to the west. The island has a broken ship, an, uh, shipwreck. Very old shipwreck, they say.
