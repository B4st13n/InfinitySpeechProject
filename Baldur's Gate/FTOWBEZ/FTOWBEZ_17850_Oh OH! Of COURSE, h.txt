Oh? OH! Of COURSE, how foolish of me! You'll be keeping quiet, so as to catch the bandits in the area by surprise! Brilliant! That means you'll be heading north to the last ambush sites. Don't worry, I won't tell a SOUL! Well, maybe Shallie. She'll never believe I met you. Oh, and maybe Dilben and Wadsworth too. I'll HAVE to tell them, just to show them up. Don't you worry though. Not a soul other than them!
