I don't know who you are, but I'm glad to see you nonetheless. I canna be done with this place soon enough! I don't fancy the look of you, but if you be against the Throne you've my best blessings. In fact, I'll do you better than blessings. This mine was once my clan-home, and after that my clan-tomb. We breached a riverbank over a hundred years ago and most of us died. A few survived, but we left the mine flooded as a monument to the dead. I got trade-work at the Iron Throne smithing, but I then told my "friend" Rieltar about my old home. They chained me up and tortured the location out of me, and now my home feeds the Iron Throne and their evil plans. I'd sooner destroy it again than have the Throne use it so! Here are directions to the lower levels. They plugged the hole to the river, but knowing hands can loose it again! Flood the blackguards out! I must leave, I can bear the sight of this place no longer. I'll black a few eyes on the way out though! Clangeddin's might be with you!
