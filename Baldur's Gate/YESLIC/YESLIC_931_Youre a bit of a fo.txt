You're a bit of a fool to refuse any help, though perhaps foolhardy risks are called for. So be it, I'll go my own way. I will tell you how to hurt these blackguards though. This mine here, it was my clan's long ago. We were just tapping the richest ore deposits when we breached a riverbank. Most of us died, and those that lived left the mine a flooded tomb. So here's the fool me, who gets a trade with the Iron Throne. My "friend" Rieltar learns of my past and tortures the mine location outta me! Now my clan graveyard feeds the Throne while they starve the coast of ore. Here be directions to the river breach. Knowing hands can loosen the magical plug and flood the mine again. Do this for me, and for yourselves if you be against the Throne. I'll make my way out without you, but I'll black a few eyes on the way.
