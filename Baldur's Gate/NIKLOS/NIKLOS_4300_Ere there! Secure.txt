 'Ere there! Secure the door behind you, lest some passing spy put the eyes on us! What are you doing back in the "Gate"? Every night-walker in town be keeping a low-end profile, what with the guards putting force behind their swords. Not safe to wander; not safe at all. Alatos has gone deep under, so as not to be warmin' a bunk in the jailhouse... or worse! Lost most our number, we have. Stay if you wish, but here be no more safe than the street outside.
