Who are you that you can just barge in here? With travel so dangerous, it's no wonder there are but ruffians like you left in town. Please leave lest the children get upset because of the strangers in their house. They'll hardly sleep now for fear they'll miss even a second with their father if he should come home. I wish I had their faith.
