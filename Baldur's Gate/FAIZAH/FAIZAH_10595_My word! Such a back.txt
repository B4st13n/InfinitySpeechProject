My word! Such a backache I have! I feel as though I have been standing for ages! I thank you for releasing me, and now I await your price. I am well acquainted with mercenaries and the like, and know that one does not rescue such as I for the good of one's health. Though you wish much of me, there is nothing I can give. I will be off now, before you try to force something from me.
