Who dares presume to trespass upon nature's territory whilst a Shadow Archdruid looks on? Who could be so hungry for death...? Wait. I recognize you as those that travel with Faldorn. She has served the Shadow Druids well, and if she deems you worthy to share her cause, then you shall have free passage. Do not delude yourselves into thinking you have gained our favor. Such alliances are as fickle as the gusting wind.
