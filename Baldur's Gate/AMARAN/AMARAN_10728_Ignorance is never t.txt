Ignorance is never to be pardoned! Lessons hard learned are the ones best remembered. I shall enlighten you and then pose my question again. I am an Archdruid of the Shadow Druids, one of the few with my level of experience, and it is our duty to purge nature of outsiders. Druidic orders that think people can exist alongside nature are doomed to fail. We shall restore nature to its former glory the only way possible: active aggression! So again I put it to you: Who are you to dare trespass in nature's territory?
