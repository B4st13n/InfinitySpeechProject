You seek to destroy that which those heathens have built? Perhaps you warrant temporary passage then, though you shall still be under my scrutiny. You will find a human fort if you continue north and then go east. It is inhabited by defilers who call themselves the Iron Throne. It would be best if one of our own accompanied you to be sure that your intent is true. Seek the one named Faldorn; she will join your cause. Her rage at those who would defile this land can barely be contained and will no doubt benefit your cause. Go now; do not tarry in places you do not belong.
