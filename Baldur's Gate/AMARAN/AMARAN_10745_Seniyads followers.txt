Seniyad's followers are well-known to me; you travel with the one known as Jaheira. Her naive views of society living in harmony with nature must be cleansed from the world so that nature may regain the respect it deserves! As a Shadow Archdruid it falls to me to be the sickle that cleaves your parasitic taint from this forest! There will be no talking, no negotiation!
