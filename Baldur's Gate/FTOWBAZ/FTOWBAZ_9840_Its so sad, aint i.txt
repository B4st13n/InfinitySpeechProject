It's so sad, ain't it? Duke Entar Silvershield, dead. I swear he was the most levelheaded of the bunch, and now he's gone. With Duke Eltan sick they'll likely move that Sarevok in, mostly because he's got the backing of the Iron Throne. We're in for it then, I think. That Sarevok is intent on "punishing" Amn, but I swears it just don't make sense.
