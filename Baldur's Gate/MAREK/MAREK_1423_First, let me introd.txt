First, let me introduce the two of us. I'm Marek and this is my companion, Lothander. I thought it would be nice for you to know our names, 'cause if you don't take our advice you'll be seeing more of us two. I know that you've been taking an active interest in destroying the Iron Throne, don't try to deny it. My companion and I are in the employ of the aforementioned Throne. We thought it would be polite to give you one last warning: Stop interfering with our employer's business. You can decide to disregard this warning, but if you do, it'll be the last decision you ever make. See ya later.
