Well... I've been hearing all kinda things about what's been going on in the city. The commander of the Flaming Fist, Duke Eltan, went and got sick. His second-in-command got a wee bit worse luck and got himself killed. There's some fella named Sarevok who's been causin' quite the stir among the upper crust.
