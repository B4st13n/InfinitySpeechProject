If I were not already incensed at Sarevok, I would stop to tear a strip off of you too. As it is, I must speak with the Grand Dukes about Sarevok's conduct! Imagine! He secures himself as leader of the Iron Throne and then all but destroys its mercantile credibility by practically sacking it! He may be bolstering the city with its assets, but it is still unprofessional! Something strange is going on at that Iron Throne building, I tell you! I know their previous leadership was killed, but those members remaining would still never let such treatment come to pass. Not willingly, anyway.
