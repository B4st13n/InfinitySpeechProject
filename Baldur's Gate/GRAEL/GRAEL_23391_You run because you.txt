You run because you are fearful of what we are... what I am? You will see much worse here, and places yet unknown. If you cannot stomach what I have become, then you will surely fall to others. I will do a service for you! I will show you suffering here! You may survive elsewhere if you survive here, and if you die, you will have been spared the waiting and worrying. This I do for you!
