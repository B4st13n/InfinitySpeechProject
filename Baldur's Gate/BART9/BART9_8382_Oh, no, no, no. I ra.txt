Oh, no, no, no. I rather think someone of your standards will not be comfortable in the Helm and Cloak at all. We pride ourselves on our somewhat expensive but relaxed fare, whereas you seem to be the sort who should enjoy the atmosphere of, say, the Blushing Mermaid. I am sorry to say it, but I did not mean that as a compliment. Best that you go now, for surely it will only mean trouble if you stay. Is there anything I can do for you?
