Good eve. The Helm and Cloak stands ready to serve thee in a swift and relaxing manner. I trust you are aware that our provender is a touch more pricey than some of the "lesser respected" inns about town? This is true, though I have always maintained that you get what you pay for. Is there anything I can do for you?
