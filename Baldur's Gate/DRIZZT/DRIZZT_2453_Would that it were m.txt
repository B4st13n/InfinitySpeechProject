Would that it were my only battle to fight, but I doubt that, upon thinking carefully, you would truly want my help. Many a powerful creature view me as enemy. Would you truly wish to cross a balor's gaze? Your path is yours alone to follow. Just tread carefully, and remember that your sword is secondary to your mind. Your opponents may have a harder time matching your wit than your blade.
