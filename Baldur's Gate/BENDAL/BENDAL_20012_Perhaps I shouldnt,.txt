Perhaps I shouldn't, but that Koveras is such an odd fellow, and I have not seen him around before now. I should think I would be aware of any new brethren joining us, but he just appeared the other day. Perhaps he is a visiting sage, but he seems very disinterested in our tomes, and more interested in our visitors. Bah, I am being silly. It is not for me to decide how someone should spend his or her day. I shall continue my studies. Good day to you.
