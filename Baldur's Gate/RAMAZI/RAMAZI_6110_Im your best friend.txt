I'm your best friend! It's a strange feeling being friends with such as you; after all, you're far beneath me in intellect and possess very few good mannerisms. I doubt I can tell you much that you would find useful; most of my work is far beyond your limited perceptions. I'm sorry that I could not be more useful as a friend.
