I can't believe I lost my dagger. Hey there! You're more adventurers huh? My name's Kylee, and I gotta say it's good to have some armed people down here. Well, I hope you do better than the last bunch. Gods be damned, I lost my dagger, and with all that's been going on, I feel kinda naked without it.
