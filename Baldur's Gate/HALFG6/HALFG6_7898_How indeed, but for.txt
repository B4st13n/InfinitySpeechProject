How indeed, but for having been there myself! Ahh, it was the grand old days when I roamed the land, stirring up trouble as I went. Swung a blade with the best, I did! Of course the rest of the village thought me mad... MAD, for leaving house and hearth! They just could not understand, but they welcomed me back when the rigors of the road left me somewhat aged. Still, what a grand time it was! Stay by my fire and mayhaps sometime we shall swap tales of derring-do over a mug or three! Just not right now. I am a mite tired and need my rest.
