Why, how does anyone who travels the roads claim to know another? By the little glint of madness in the eye and the feet that never stay still. You are welcome in my home, but keep your weapons at your sides and your fingers in your pockets. We are all friends here, and I should hate to lose that friendship over a few measly trinkets.
