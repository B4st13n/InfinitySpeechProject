An attitude that will suffice, I suppose. Striving to be free or refusing to be dominated: six of one or a half dozen of another. This difference is unimportant for now, though sometime in the future such brash traits may prove to be a weakness. We shall see. For now, I offer basic advice and a few names. Scar of the Flaming Fist is a good man, and well worth trusting. His superior, Duke Eltan, is also a good sort. Both are to be believed when they speak. I take my leave, and wish thee well.
