I don't know! I swear it! All I can say is that the regional leaders of the Iron Throne placed Davaeorn here! There are three of them, I think, but I don't know their names! Davaeorn was getting orders from someone else too, he complained about it a lot, but he never said a name or anything to me! Honest! The main building for the Iron Throne is in Baldur's Gate, somewhere in the southwest of the city, but I have never been there! I tell you true! Can I please go?
