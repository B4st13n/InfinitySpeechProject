Ah, indeed. You walk well with Shaella in the mists of Leira. Forgotten deep in the library of Candlekeep lies the Great Book of the Unknowing. Bound with the chameleon's hide, it too walks in the mists of Leira, changing always, as does Shaella. Ask no one there of it for all who have touched it are blessed with the ignorance it grants. But you can always find it somewhere in the inner rooms, wreathed in the mists of Leira. Go to it, make your pilgrimage, and you too may be blessed with unknowing.
