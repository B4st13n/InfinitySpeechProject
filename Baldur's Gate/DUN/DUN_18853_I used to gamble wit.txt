I used to gamble with those fellows but something's not right. I'm in debt to them up to my ears but nothin's happening. No big guys with clubs knocking on my door in the middle of the night, no poison in my ale, nothing. It's like they've forgotten the whole thing. I saw my old buddy Al in the street the other day, looked him right in the eye, and he didn't even cuff me about the ears. Just started looking real nervous like he had forgotten his best friend's name at a party or something. Strange, I tell you.
