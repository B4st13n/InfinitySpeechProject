No need to be rude! If yer "important task" is finding that big armored guy, then he went right down the stairs to the east. He and his friend were sure in a hurry. If I were you though, I'd first stock up on equipment. Those are the thief warrens down the stairs, and they ain't no place any sane man would care to go. Go talk to Black Lily in the store room by the stairs. She has lots of items for sale, even magic if you have the money.
