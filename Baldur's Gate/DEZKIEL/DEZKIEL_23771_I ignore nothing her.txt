I ignore nothing here, and I see far more than you. I have been here long and have used my time effectively. Some fall or go mad, but I have learned. Do I understand this place? No, but I begin to. It stores what it brings for something long since forgotten. Perhaps when I remember it I will master it... perhaps not. You are but an interloper, a messenger, and the power of someone else will remove you from afar. Do what you must, I can only gain in this. I win, I am released. I lose, I am released.
