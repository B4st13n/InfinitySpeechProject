I was talking about the Iron Throne's actions since Sarevok has assumed control of it. He is disinterested, and seems likely to sacrifice it to fund the re-arming of Baldur's Gate, and thus his bid to become a Grand Duke. It is the Iron Throne's instability which has prolonged the strife in the city, and that is why other merchants blame them. They were major importers, and without their help it will take much longer to reassure people that all is well. It makes no business sense that they should do this, and I think there is something very wrong at their headquarters.
