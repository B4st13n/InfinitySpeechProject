Hello hello. I don't suppose you would be interested in a few trinkets? A coin or two for my finely crafted wares? Ehh, I thought not. The iron shortage wanes, but even so, the customers do not come back quite yet. Who can blame them though? They are afraid because they see that the merchants are still without wares. Who believes that a shortage has ended, when they still cannot hold a new blade in their hands? I blame the Iron Throne, I do. Many others do as well.
