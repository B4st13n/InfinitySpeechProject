Nothing direct, I suppose, though the impact is still harsh. Since Sarevok assumed control, they have ceased most business transactions and frozen most of their assets. They were major importers, and without their active help, it will be much longer before the average citizen feels that the crisis is over. It would seem that Sarevok is going to use the Iron Throne to fuel his harsh stance on Amn and thus his bid for the position of Grand Duke. The fact that he is crippling a large merchant house seems inconsequential to him. I cannot imagine sane businessmen following such directives. Something is very odd at the Iron Throne building indeed.
