But that was not the family that knew YOU, and knows you now. I think you feel the pull, and I think you strain against it still. Ahh, again you see that I know much of you, perhaps more than you know yourself. There are three things that are strength incarnate: there is love of life, there is fear of death, and there is family. A family that loves death would have a strong pull indeed. Can you... feel it? Can you feel him? He hates you, you know.
