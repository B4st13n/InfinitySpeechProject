Hello again, <CHARNAME>. I fear this time I have not come to speak, and must take up arms against you. You have... you have done what you must, I suppose. Sarevok knows of my treachery, you know. He has forsaken me, left me to die in your path. I must fight to regain his trust, his... attention. And so I stand before you, knowing that if I defeat you he will continue his plans elsewhere and I shall lose him, and if you defeat me, you shall go on to kill him. He will not yield to either of us. I have... I have no choice.
