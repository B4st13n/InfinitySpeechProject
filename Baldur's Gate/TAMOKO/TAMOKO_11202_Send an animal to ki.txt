Send an animal to kill an animal. Appropriate, if unsavory. Perhaps you could... There is another that should be... removed. Atop the Iron Throne base is a woman whose influence is a poison in Sarevok's soul. If she were removed, I know he would listen to reason, to my pleading. Cythandria is her name, and she holds much power in this matter. She seeks Sarevok's favor as well, though she is content if he self-destructs, so long as she profits in the deed. I must go. Sarevok cannot know I have helped you.
