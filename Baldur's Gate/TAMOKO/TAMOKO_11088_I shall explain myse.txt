I shall explain myself in further detail when I have time. Until then, I have but one thing to say: The one who claims to heal Duke Eltan's sickness is also the one who breeds it. Likely there have been signs that suggested this to you, but none have said it so plain. No doubt you have the wherewithal to follow through on it. Your very nature gives you above average competence. Gorion's tutelage could only have enhanced this.
