It is fools like you who do the most harm! The trees were not placed for your enjoyment, and to treat them as mere entertainment is to demean them in ways I cannot stand! No Shadow Druid would ever condone such flagrant squandering of the gifts of the earth! I shall avenge each flower you might have trod on, and every leaf you might have shaken loose in your passing!
