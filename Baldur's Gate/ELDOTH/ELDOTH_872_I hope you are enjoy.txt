I hope you are enjoying your liquor; it is some of the best you can find. All of you are probably wondering why I'm being so generous, "obviously not from the kindness of his heart," you think. Well, in a way, I am. You look like the type to be on the outlook for ways to improve the quality of your life. Well, I have a proposal that could help you in that endeavor. You see, there's a girl, my lover in fact, who desires to escape her father and live on her own. Her father is Entar Silvershield, one of the dukes of Baldur's Gate. This, of course, makes her desires more difficult than that of the average city girl. However, with your assistance, we could help her escape the tyrannical clutches of Entar. Here's the punchline: Since Entar's going to be hunting us anyway, we can blackmail him for hoards of cash and not worry about our captive escaping. After all, we're doing it all for the sake of Skie. Now, we needn't go about this right away. In fact, I'll help you with whatever you're doing until you decide to head up to Baldur's Gate. Just think of it as one favor deserving another.
