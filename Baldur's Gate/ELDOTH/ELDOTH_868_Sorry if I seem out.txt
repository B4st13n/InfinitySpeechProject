Sorry if I seem out of breath, but I had to retreat from a battle. I was ambushed by a dozen gnolls farther back on the trail. I handily dispatched them but thought better of fighting their half dozen ogre friends. I think I've evaded them for now. Would any of you care for a drink of some fine Selgauntian brandy?
