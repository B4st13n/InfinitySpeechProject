Excellent, though "a little while" is not quite what I had in mind. You see, there's a matter of a teeny weeny curse that that mean ol' Durlag put on me. A tiny thing really, but I need your help. You want to help me, don't you? Hmm? I need someone brave and strong to do something for me. I need you to stay here instead of me. Will you do this? Will you do this for me?
