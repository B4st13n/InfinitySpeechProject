The Flaming Fist have taken it upon themselves to pursue the local thieving community somewhat more... aggressively than usual. I venture they are still a tad miffed by the death of their commander in chief, Scar. His replacement Angelo is a bit more... driven. If ye wish to keep to the streets ye had best be right bloody good at the clandestine. As for me, I'm, as the saying goes, exiting stage left.
