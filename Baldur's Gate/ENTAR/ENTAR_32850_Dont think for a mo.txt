Don't think for a moment, dear Skie, that I do not know what you get up to - I will not have it! This commoner does not have a hint of breeding in him. Why do you insist on putting me through this unending hardship? Our lives are difficult enough without your indelicacies. Now, please, remove them from our home or I'll have the guards do it.
