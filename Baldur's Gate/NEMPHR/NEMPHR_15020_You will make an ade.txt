You will make an adequate pawn. Don't argue, as I have little patience for your prattle. There is a dark mage at work somewhere in this city and he must be stopped. He goes by the name of Arkion and has a bloodstone amulet that is of great importance to my plans. Return it to me and I will reward you greatly.
