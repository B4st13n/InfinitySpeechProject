Thieves access their skills using the icons along the bottom of their screen. "Thieving" includes Open Locks, Pick Pockets, and Find Traps, when used in conjunction with the appropriate targets (chests, people, and traps, respectively). "Find Traps" examines a general area and outlines found traps in red. "Stealth" uses Move Silently and Hide In Shadows to render a Thief effectively invisible until their next attack. That attack is automatically a backstab, increasing the damage of a successful hit dramatically.
