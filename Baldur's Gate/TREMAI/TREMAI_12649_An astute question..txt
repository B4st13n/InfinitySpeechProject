An astute question. High Priest Chanthalas has deemed that Casson knowingly took a risk, and luck determined his fate. Since Tymora be the Lady of Luck, it is that fate we are officially to abide by. I, however, disagree. While Casson did dare and fail, I see no reason that I should not take the risk to rescue him. It makes no sense to me for Tymora to grant her servants resurrection powers, if to use them would anger her or interfere with the "fate" of another. So now I find I must move against the wishes of my church, but not the spirit of it. To me, it seems that they are more concerned about incurring the wrath of the Umberlants than in following the spirit of adventure. You may anger her clergy by helping me, but I believe Tymora will smile on all of us.
