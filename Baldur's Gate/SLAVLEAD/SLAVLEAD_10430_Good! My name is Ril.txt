Good! My name is Rill, and I'm the de facto leader of the slaves here beneath the Cloakwood. I heard about you, because I'm always careful to listen to what the Blacktalons talk about. It seems that the Iron Throne has placed a large price on the head of someone named <CHARNAME>, which would be you, I assume. Enough introductions, we don't have much time. I need 100 gold. The captain of the Blacktalons on the first floor is not known for his loyalty to the Throne. If you give me the money, I'm sure I could bribe him to look the other way, while I escape with the rest of the slaves. After all, most of the Talons are going to be preoccupied with you. Well, how about it?
