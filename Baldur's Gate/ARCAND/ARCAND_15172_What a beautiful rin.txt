What a beautiful ring! Where'er did you get it? (Most likely quite near where exactly I put it...) Wertle, oh wertle, oh dear wertle-wooo... wertle, oh wertle, oh woo... Oh, I know what you're thinking of Mad Arcand the Stinking who takes what you give him and gives not in return. So here, take this bottle, but please don't unstopple or (wertle, poor wertle), you'll surely get burned.
