There is a way. We did start to build a ship-home. After all, if we can build the wall and village, we can build the craft to leave. The first of the mothers were concerned with survive, but now we wish to go. The beasts have caused us trouble no end though. We could not build ship-home on this edge of island because of reef and cliffs below the sea. The other side of the isle is calm, but the creatures live there. We have fought tooth and nail, but we wish peace in life. Perhaps... perhaps you can help? If you kill the beasts, we would be free to leave all. I trust you have charts for sea directions? If we could finish ship-home, we could be delivered all.
