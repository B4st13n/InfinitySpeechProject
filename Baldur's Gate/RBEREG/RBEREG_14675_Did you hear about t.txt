Did you hear about the assassinations at Candlekeep? Seems that the leaders of the Iron Throne went and got themselves killed. Those same people who helped the folks down in Nashkel did the deed. They were Amnian agents, I hear. Anyhow, one of the dead guys' sons is now the leader, Sarevok is his name I think.
