Some tales defy all logic or explanation when posed to the sane mind, and it is a story just so that I give to you now. Much of it is already known, due to the celebrity of those involved, though many may find it truly shocking how deep the seeds of destruction were sewn. Beloved Sarevok, a man among men, set to all but rule the coast, was actually a core architect of the very iron shortage that so unraveled the economy of the land, and had a hand in the poisoning of Duke Eltan that directly led to his rise to power. We were but seconds away from the first step down that path when from the shadows again stepped the unknown group of my previous tales. None can say definitively what happened next, though it is certain that Sarevok was pursued to the very bottom of the Undercity, and from there he did not return. I'll wager many would just as soon have seen him chased to the 9th plane itself, as he hurt many of the folk of the land, both direct and indirect.
