Greetings, fellow traveler, for I see by your garb that you do not call this place home. Sit with me awhile and enjoy the atmosphere of this fine fair while we recount tales of lands far and far-seeming. I have wandered the width and breadth of Faer√ªn, but yet have I to find such hospitality as that of a simple country festival. It's a shame that the festivities are marred by the events as of recent, though they certainly put up a brave face, do they not? You look confused, so perhaps you know not of the local trouble that continues to vex the most gracious people of Nashkel. If you have just arrived, I could, for the price of an ale and an ear, relate what I know. Shall I tell you of their mining difficulties or relate the tale of their unfortunate commander of the guard?
