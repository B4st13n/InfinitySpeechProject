Many a story have I collected from across this great realm, though sometimes I am at a loss whether to believe them or not, due to their extraordinary circumstance. Such a tale is this, wherein lies the story of a band of hearty adventurers moving amidst the shadows of the land, effecting change where it is needed. I was enjoying the simple fare of the celebrations in Nashkel, when the strangest news hit the town. It would seem the mines, long plagued by unexplained deaths, had been inundated by a horde of ill-mannered kobolds, under the direction of a rather unscrupulous and hygienically suspect cleric of Cyric. Dispatching of the villain with appropriate brevity, the heroes freed the mine, and are the sole reason for the trickle of iron finally winding its way to the Gate now. None seem to recall their names, but the consensus agrees they were great of stature, and cut an impressive figure across the plains.
