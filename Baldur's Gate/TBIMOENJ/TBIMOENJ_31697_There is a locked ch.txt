There is a locked chest on the west side of this floor. Use my abilities to pick the lock of the chest and steal the gem inside. To aid in finding chests and other containers, you can use the Hint button. The Hint button is at the bottom right of the screen and has a magnifying glass over a barrel. When you tap this button, objects that you can interact with will be highlighted for a moment.
