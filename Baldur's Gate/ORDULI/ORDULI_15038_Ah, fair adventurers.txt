Ah, fair adventurers. The roads of this fair city are lined with fools, are they not? Two of the greatest are Arkion and Nemphre, necromancers grown bitter over lost love. Alas, but they use petty trinkets as their excuse for enmity. Nemphre covets Arkion's bloodstone amulet and Arkion dreams of her onyx ring. Steal those trinkets and bring them to me and perhaps those two fools can at last find peace.
