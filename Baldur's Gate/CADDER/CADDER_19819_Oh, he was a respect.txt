Oh, he was a respected sage before I was old enough to lift the Tome of Universal Harmony, let alone understand a word. He knew a great deal about this world, and much of the next as well. I heard rumors of his escapades with those who harp as well, but he never spoke of such things to me. I get the feeling that he devoted most of his attentions to raising you, and gave up whatever ribald life he lived in his youth. He would not have had it any other way, though. You seem to have fared well enough for it.
