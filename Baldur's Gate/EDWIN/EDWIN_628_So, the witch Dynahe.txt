So, the witch Dynaheir is dead! I would have thought her more formidable to be so far from her homeland. Why then was she here? Her demise is not the checkmate I had hoped for, merely the check. What? What do you want?! (Oh yes, the matter of payment, although I begin to doubt whether their input was all that vital. Still, something for their trouble is in order, if only to appease them.) As we never fixed a price, your payment shall be one year of my services as a wizard. I am sure you agree that my guidance will be far more valuable than any monetary sum.
