Yeah, people come from all over to see the books here. All sorts of folks, too: bards, nobles, priests, mages. Volo's even been here and Elminster, too, remember. A couple of just plain old merchants even wandered in the other day. Said they were with the Iron Throne and were here to do some business. They're still around, last I heard.
