My name is Deagan, and I'm a servitor to Aldeth Sashenstar. Recently there have been problems at the Merchants' League Estate, which my master owns. He gave me orders to find a team of mercenaries that would be able to help him out. I really don't have much more to say, unless you'd like to hear about the problems I've been having with my wife. No? Okay then.
