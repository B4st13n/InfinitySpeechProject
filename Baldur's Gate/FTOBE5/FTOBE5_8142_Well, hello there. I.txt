Well, hello there. I fear you have "mistaken" my unlocked door as an invitation to enter. Forgive me if this was misleading, as it was not my intent to allow entry to just any stranger off the street. Please accept my apologies, but I should appreciate it if you would leave. Mine husband is one of the guards and I should think he would be perturbed if there were people milling about his house when he got home.
