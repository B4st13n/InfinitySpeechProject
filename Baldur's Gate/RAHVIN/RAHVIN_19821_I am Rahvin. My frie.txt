I am Rahvin. My friends and I are mercenaries in the employ of the Iron Throne. We've been sent to hunt down Sarevok. Seems as if he went crazy and started murdering all who got in his way, including Rieltar, and the Throne don't take too well to having their high-ups killed. You know... the longer I talk to you the more familiar you become. You're <CHARNAME>, aren't you? Well, well, well... it seems as if we've gotten lucky. Killing you will give us a nice hefty bonus. Sorry 'bout this, but you're not wanted dead or alive, only dead.
