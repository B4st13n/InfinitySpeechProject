Greetings, Faldorn. I see that you have made some new friends. Well, I hope your crusade against the Iron Throne goes well. Well, I shouldn't bother you for too long. On your way now, Faldorn, and know that Laskal watches over you. Before you go, a word of advice. Watch for the druid known as Seniyad, he could give you trouble. You know how the other orders view our methods.
