I should say so, though not as many as in the past. People are avoiding the roads because of the recent troubles, as I am sure you are aware. We keep up a strong front though, and I know we'll get through just fine. The people of "the Gate" have always been good at adapting. Why, in my day we could weather month-long storms with nothing but a log or two, the skins of a few unfortunate bears, and the warm company of those we held dear. Of course, in those days trees were bigger, you understand? A good stout log could fire the hearth for a tenday, though you'd have to empty out the stables for a place to keep them dry. Likewise the pelt of an adult grizzly could carpet your whole house. And company? Company was HUGE! I remember old skinny Morgan. Nigh unto a giant he was. Soft at heart though...
