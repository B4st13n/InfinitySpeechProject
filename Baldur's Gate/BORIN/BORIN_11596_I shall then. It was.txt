I shall then. It was the dawning of a new year, and Chester Blackboot and I were off to rally our friends and storm the gates of the old Firewine ruins. Vella Stablehand was at the head; she was the eldest, you understand. We pretty much agreed that she would take point and absorb most of the initial damage were we attacked. Of course Vella had her father's axe too, and that made her an imposing sight at the forefront. She was tall as a pine and could deliver a backhand like you were so much silt on the breeze. I remember a time when she and Chester—this was Chester Allendale, no relation to the Blackboots (and a good thing too. Them Blackboots had not patience for Vella and her shenanigans)—well, Chester and Vella were spelunking in the Ulcaster (at least, that's what the kids called it in those days) and her father comes up and by golly, Vella up and belts Chester so hard he didn't hit the ground for a week. Vella's father sees this and laughs so hard he plumb forgets he's mad. He's like that though, and the day he passes up a good joke will be the day he passes on entirely. I remember a time...
