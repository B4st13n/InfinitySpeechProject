Ah, Baldur's Gate is nearly a jail itself in these times, but that doesn't stop the guard from locking you away for the slightest reason. The entire city is on edge, and every member of the Flaming Fist is out for blood. Can't say that I blame them. I would be right upset if I was in their shoes. Scar, their second-in-command, was killed recently. Don't really know the circumstances—some say it was accident, some say murder—but it has only served to increase tensions. Especially since Duke Entar Silvershield was assassinated. No guesswork as to what happened there.
