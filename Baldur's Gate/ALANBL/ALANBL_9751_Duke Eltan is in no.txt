Duke Eltan is in no position to prevent it. As I understand it, he is barely clinging to life. No one seems to be able to help him, even though he is attended around the clock by a healer named Rashad. You didn't hear this from me, but I've a few friends that know of this Rashad. Let's just say that I do not put much faith in Duke Eltan surviving the week.
