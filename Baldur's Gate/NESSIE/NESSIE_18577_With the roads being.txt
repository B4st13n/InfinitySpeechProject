With the roads being what they are right now, there aren't too many faces around here that are new anymore. Unshey's been taking this time to write a new book, and Khalid and Jaheira have been waiting anxiously in the corner over there, sleeping in shifts to make sure they don't miss whoever it is they're waiting for... Dorn's over there in the opposite corner, as far from Khalid and Jaheira as possible. I'd steer clear of him if I had a choice... Who else? Let's see, Landrin's on the top floor, drinking up a storm, and then there was... well, Tarnesh... I'm really sorry he caused you troubleâ€”he was all wit and charm until he heard that there were visitors at the gate... We don't allow any fighting here. We have very strict rules about that sort of thing but the guards say he jumped out of the shadows at you and there was nothing you could do... That's really about it. Everyone else has been here for the past two months, at least. We're so full that there's even been talk of letting people throw down their bedrolls in the temple.
