Me? Oh, I'm a hermit. Well, I'm rather new at it actually, and I haven't quite got the isolation bit down yet. Too much of a people-person, I suppose. Used to be a merchant in Nashkel I did, but lost everything due to the iron shortage. Been wandering the woods for a while now and it's been rather relaxing, I must say. Aside from eluding the occasional bandit, that is. I'm generally left alone because I have nothing of value.
