Some fool is accused of their murders, but likely he was just some stooge. I know who is truly behind it, I am sure! Sarevok had to have been the cause! He came back here when they were not a day dead, and claimed the leadership for his own! I do not understand him though. He wrests control of everything for himself, but his actions are those of one who cares little for mercantile power. The iron crisis became his pet project, but he has used it to inflame and cause unrest, not to get wealth or power. He seems to want to propel the region into war. Whatever his motive, I'll not let him get away with it. Who ARE you, by the way?
