Bassilus keeps on tellin' these stories about how happy he was as a kid, but all of the spooks just kinda moan and mumble and stuff, like they're not really listening. That's what my brother Johnny used to do before he disappeared, mumble like that when he weren't really listening... You stay here. I'm gonna go tell my friend Netty 'bout this place. She'll think it's really funny, what with her daddy gone and all.
