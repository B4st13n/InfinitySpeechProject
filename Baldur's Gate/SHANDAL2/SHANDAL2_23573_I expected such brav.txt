I expected such bravado from you. Such is the mind of they that would prove their mettle by slaughtering three simple children! You have participated in the murder of the daughters of Shandalar and, surprisingly enough, I consider that a verrry naughty act! What have you to say for yourself in defense? State why I should not make interesting little noisemakers from your vertebrae and sell them to bugbear children!
