So you say, but your actions have branded you less than desirable. Do you even have the will to try to restrain your ways while here, or are you a lost cause and just content with it? I shall determine and judge as I see fit, for none else here have the power to do so. You will perform a task for me. I will send you where you must go, and you will return with the item I need. A simple cloak is your target, but do NOT wear it! It is mine, and you will know the punishment before you get a second chance.
