Your pitiful attempts and lies are as transparent to me as the nature of existence. No, wait, that's still fairly opaque. But YOU, you I see clearly for I see true! Do you really believe that one versed in magic such as me could not identify those responsible for the deaths of his children? You have a long road of repentance ahead of you, and no one is offering a ride! I send you! I send you on a pitiable errand! The means of your return will be found if you look, but do not expect the way to be easy! If you do well, I might yet decide not to invert your faces! Away, away, AWAY! And bring me back a lovely souvenir! A cloak perhaps!
