Your argument falls short of becoming a reason not to kill you! I suppose it is my fault and not the thief's if I am burgled in my home? After all, it is not his fault that I amassed wealth and dared to "display" it in mine home. In a mob rule you might have a chance, but I am but a mob of one! Shandalar spits at you and condemns with the same breath! You will perform a duty to me as part of penance, and if you succeed, you will be a measure closer to repayment! I send you! I send you and you may not return without a lovely souvenir! A cloak, perhaps!
