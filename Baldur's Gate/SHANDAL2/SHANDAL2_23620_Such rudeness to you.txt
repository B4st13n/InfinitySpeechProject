Such rudeness to your extremely powerful elders will only serve to get you roasted on a lightning spit while diseased gibberlings suckle your toes... But I digress, just a touch. I would ask a task of you, and now I think it all the more appropriate that you accept. I will judge the measure of you and see what your respectable veneer has paneled over. You will retrieve a cloak for me, one that was left in a rather unfortunate place. When you have found it, you will be returned. I think you will agree this is a menial chore.
