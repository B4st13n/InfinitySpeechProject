You return. I cannot say I am totally pleased with that, but you have done me a service, nonetheless. You may live, but we are still not square and fair. Cross my path again and the deaths of my daughters will be the fuel that drives my anger! You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. For now, I am satisfied, but only for now. Leave me now.
