He was a fixture in this city, sharp of wit and fair of face... Indeed I loved him once, we all did! Ghorak and his brother Kereph. We were like giggling girls scattering ourselves at their feet and they treated each of us with such respect and dignity. Lady Luck loved them too, it seemed, but she is a fickle and cruel mistress. Kereph is long dead, you see, and Ghorak bears the plague. Aye, like a spurned lover, Tymora turns her loves away that she may draw them closer in the end.
