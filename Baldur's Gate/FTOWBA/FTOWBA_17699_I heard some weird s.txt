I heard some weird stuff about the merchant consortiums in town. Both the Seven Suns and Merchants' League have been acting real strange of late. Then there's that new Iron Throne that just moved in. They took over that huge abandoned tower in the west side of town. Well, that's all I really know. It was nice meeting some real adventurers. Bye now.
