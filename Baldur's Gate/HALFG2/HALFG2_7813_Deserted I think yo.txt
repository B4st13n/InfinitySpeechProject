Deserted? I think you will find that even if an owner were to stray from his hearth for years, friends and neighbors would keep his home warm and welcoming for his return. If a stranger felt the need to use it in the meantime, I could see no one with cause to object. No need for you to apologize. If my home seemed deserted, that simply means that I must strive all the more to present a welcoming friendly face. Cyrrollalee would settle for nothing less.
