Such manners! I can think of no other in the history of this village to have insulted me so! As much as Cyrrollalee demands welcome hospitality, at least a small measure of gratitude is expected in return. You are not welcome in my burrow, and I think you will find the same is true among my neighbors if you continue to act as such.
