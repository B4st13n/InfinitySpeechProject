Please, I beg of you to go no further! Brage is there, strewn about with the carnage he has wrought. I have tried to reason with him but it is as if he is possessed by another's soul. It was all I could do to flee the swing of his tremendous blade. Please, unless you wish to witness madness in a once-good man, leave him be and pray the spirit leaves him in good time.
