I heard that the Merchants' League Estate is having a lot of trouble. Seems that the three owners are squabbling about how to run the place. The Iron Throne's been taking advantage of that situation. If things continue as they are, the Throne soon won't have any competition. Kinda strange considering they only moved into the city a couple of years back.
