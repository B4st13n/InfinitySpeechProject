Liability?! I shall be a danger to no one but myself! You lose nothing with my presence. Indeed, I can be of some use to you. The Abbot never approved, but many tomes in the keep hold magical knowledge for those who look. I have studied much in secret, and wager I am as good a mage as any of you could be. I will be NO liability.
