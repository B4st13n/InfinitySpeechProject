My friend, I am so sorry to hear this! Please, if you need to chat about anything, do not hesitate to come by my quarters. You do remember where they are, don't you? No matter. First we must make sure you get some rest. Gorion's old room is where you shall stay. No need to tell you where it is, I am sure. Third room on the south corridor, just as it was. I believe there may be a few things there that Gorion left to you. Here, let me take you to the chest.
