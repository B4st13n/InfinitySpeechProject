It seems the majority of the high-ups here in the Gate feel that you were working for Amn at the time of the assassinations. Seems to me that someone really wants to get Baldur's Gate paranoid about Amn. It's working really well. There's been talk all over the streets about how Amn is "ready to invade," a load of crap if you ask me. If you haven't heard yet, Scar, second-in-command of the Flaming Fist, was assassinated while you were at Candlekeep. The Grand Duke Eltan has been infected by some sort of magical disease; so far his healer has been unable to do anything about it. From what I've been hearing, I think that Sarevok, the new Iron Throne leader, is trying to make a grab for power in Baldur's Gate. I'd suggest that you investigate this "Sarevok." Perhaps you should break into the Iron Throne citadel. Do you have questions? 'Cause if you do, ask now; I'm on my way out of town to report to the bigwigs in Darkhold.
