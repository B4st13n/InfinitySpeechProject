I used to work with your father Gorion. I ran messages for him to his Harper friends in Waterdeep. I am saddened to hear about his death, but that is why I am here. He wanted you to have his old family ring and what limited gold he possessed. I assume you already know of the Iron Throne presence here in Candlekeep. I cannot help you deal with them as I must report this to my masters up north. I know Gorion would be proud to see you continuing his work. I must leave now, perhaps we will soon meet again.
