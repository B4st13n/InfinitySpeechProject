It's rough going on the streets these days. Used to be that a few gold would turn a guard's eye, but The Flaming Fist have put a good number of me fellows in the pokey lately. I figures they are still a touch angered by the death of that Scar fellow. His replacement Angelo seems is a bit more... driven. If ye wish to keep to the streets, ye had best be a better sneaksman than I.
