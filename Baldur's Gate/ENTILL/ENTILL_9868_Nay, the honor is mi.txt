Nay, the honor is mine, <CHARNAME>. You are a very special individual and, sadly, this has placed you in grave danger... I yearn to tell you more but I'm afraid I cannot for fear of endangering you further. Here in the city, if you wish to succeed against the Iron Throne, know that you can trust Scar and Duke Eltan, both of the Flaming Fist. They are good men and friends of ours. But I tarry too long when there are urgent matters to attend to elsewhere. We are well met, <CHARNAME>. Take care of Jaheira, for I bounced her on this very knee when she was yet a babe.
