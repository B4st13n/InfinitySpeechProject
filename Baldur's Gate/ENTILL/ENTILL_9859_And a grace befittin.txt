And a grace befitting your special heritage! Khalid has cared for you so well and kept you from the dark that was your father. Aye, and it is that dark that would have you dead, child. This city is a dangerous place for you but I understand why you have come. Trust Scar and Duke Eltan, both of the Flaming Fist. They are friends of ours and will assist you in your investigations of the Iron Throne however they are able. But I tarry too long here when grave business awaits me elsewhere. Care for Khalid in his grieving, <CHARNAME>, as he cared for you in yours.
