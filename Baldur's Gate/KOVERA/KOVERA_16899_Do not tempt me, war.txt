Do not tempt me, wardling. If you refuse to take the ring, then at least listen to some advice. The people you deal with are very dangerous, and they guard themselves well. Right now they are at their weakest. If you strike at them now, while they least expect it, you may be able to end the threat that they pose to the Sword Coast. You can take this advice or discard it, I do not care. Goodbye <CHARNAME>.
