Business, to be sure! I take no pleasure in being in these backwater towns. If not for the bandits, I would have been back amidst my silks some days ago! My corgis are going to be worried sick. Sick, I tell you! What would you know of it? You people around here are animals! You live in filth, bandits everywhere, and not a decent bathhouse to be found!
