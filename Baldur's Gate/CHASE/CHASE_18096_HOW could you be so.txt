HOW could you be so CALLOUS? I am so obviously in PAIN here! Have you no care for MY needs? No, of course not. No one does. Not Mumsey, not Daddums, not Jeeves. I bet they'd be glad I was gone. If fact, I'd probably be doing them a favor! That's it, I'll stay alive just to spite them! I'll be the most miserable, selfish, upstart of a child! Actually, this won't be much of a change, but now I'm justified! Life is good.
