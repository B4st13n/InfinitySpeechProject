As I have told you, I am the mighty magician Davaeorn! I serve Rieltar of the Iron Throne. It is my duty to keep this mine running at peak efficiency. This mine used to be in the possession of a clan of dwarves. They mined into the side of river, and most of the dwarves died in the ensuing flood. The Iron Throne has moved in and plugged the river with a magical seal. If anyone were to use the key I keep in my bedroom chest, they could open the seal and flood the mines. That would be a very bad disaster for the Iron Throne. Indeed, yes it would.
