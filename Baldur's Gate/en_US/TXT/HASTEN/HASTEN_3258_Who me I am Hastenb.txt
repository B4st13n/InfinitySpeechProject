Who me? I am Hastenback. I have my studies here like all the rest of the brethren. I also tend to the gardens and watch over Utor as well. Shame about him really. Once was a brilliant mage I hear. Apparently he found some ancient tome in a ruin somewhere. Full of forgotten magic that was not quite... compatible with the human mind. He's about three seasons old now, I reckon. Couldn't even walk when he first came here. A shame it is.
