Thine efforts to save me are well appreciated, but I cannot help but be saddened. My guardian Minsc has left this life behind. His valor and mighty berserker wrath will not go unremembered. However, as I have lost my escort and 'tis not safe to wander these lands alone, perhaps I could join with thee. My knowledge of the arcane arts would no doubt be useful, while the strength of a group would benefit me as well.
