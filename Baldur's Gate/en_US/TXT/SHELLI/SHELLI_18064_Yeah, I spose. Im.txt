Yeah, I s'pose. I'm fast though, and town is only a little ways away. I was chased by a gibberling once, but Bunky's dad is a guard and he smacked that grass monkey like it had never been hit before. They keep clear of town. Bandits don't go for kids much, neither. They only hit ya if you're packing ore to town. I gotta get back to pickin', okay?
