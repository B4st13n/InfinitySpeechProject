As it should be! Now that you have agreed, the facilities of the guild are at your disposal. Feel free to make use of them, and make your presence known to the other members. You have my permission, so they will be less likely to kill you on sight. As for your mission, you have a tenday to complete it. Informants have told me that the Duchess intends to take possession of the components that tenth day, and the exchange will be hosted by Oberan at his estate. As I see it, you have several options. Directly "persuade" any of the involved parties to hand over the items, or burgle them out from under their noses. Good luck.
