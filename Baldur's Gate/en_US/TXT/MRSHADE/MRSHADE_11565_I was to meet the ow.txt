I was to meet the owner of the pantaloons. That would be you, but it is not you. You are the wrong one, because your pantaloons are obviously STOLEN. A foolproof plan of recognition ruined, because you were daft enough to keep the pantaloons. I'll take those, and no reward for you. That'll teach you to abscond with a man's hard-earned trousers!
