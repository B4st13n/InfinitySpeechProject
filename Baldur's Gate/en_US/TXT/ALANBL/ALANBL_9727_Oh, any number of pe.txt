Oh, any number of people, really. The question is, who would have the motive? Fingers are pointing all over. Odds-on favorite is the same person who killed those merchants in Candlekeep, though no one seems to have a concrete reason. I would wager that the other Dukes are in some measure of peril as well, though Duke Eltan is close to death already. Some sort of wasting disease, though it defies curing. Hard to imagine an honest sickness that cannot be cured in this day and age.
