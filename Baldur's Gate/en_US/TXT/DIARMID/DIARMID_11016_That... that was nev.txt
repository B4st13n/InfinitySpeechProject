That... that was never the plan. Sarevok wouldn't sully his hands on those he didn't deem worthy of personally killing. For <CHARNAME> and party to be blamed they were either to be imitated by doppelgangers or fooled into attacking Rieltar and the others unprovoked. You should know this. You... you're not Prat, are you? Oh, bloody hell. Bit of a mistake on my part, wasn't it? Ah well, most of it went according to plan regardless. You'll forgive me if I don't stay for fisticuffs. Cheers.
