True, but whoever was behind the troubles before have now switched tactics. Since the iron crisis didn't weaken us significantly, they have turned to killing our leaders. Duke Entar Silvershield has been assassinated, and with Duke Eltan practically on his deathbed something must be done. An election of sorts has been called because we cannot be without a full government in these dangerous times. I hear Sarevok is a frontrunner in this matter.
