You lied to me! I told you not to lie to me. You were to leave him alone. He hates me now because of my betrayal. He finally figured it out. After all, he couldn't believe that a pathetic group such as you could undo all of his plans. Now he hates me, went berserk in fury, tried to kill me. Now I have to kill you. I have to make it up to him.
