Okay then. First off, my name really is Husam. I have never owned a business in Baldur's Gate. My associates and I belong to an organization called the Shadow Thieves; I'm sure you've heard of us. I'm here in the Gate because of the lies being spread about our organization and the nation of Amn as a whole. I'm sure you're aware how you were framed as Amnian assassins while in Candlekeep, or how the deaths of Duke Entar Silvershield and Commander Scar were blamed on the Shadow Thieves. Well... we had nothing to do with it. It seems that someone is going through a lot of trouble to create a feeling of animosity between Baldur's Gate and Amn. Amn has never been interested in a war with this city and has definitely not been responsible for all of the troubles in this region. All of that can be placed squarely upon the shoulders of the Iron Throne, or more specifically Sarevok. Now that I've told you who I am, perhaps you can tell me who you are.
