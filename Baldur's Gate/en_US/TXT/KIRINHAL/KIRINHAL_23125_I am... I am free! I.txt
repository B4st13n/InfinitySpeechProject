I am... I am free! I can feel the chains lifted! My powers return! I'll have my wings back before I reach the third plane of home! You have done as you said, and we had a fair and equitable bargain. What was it I promised? Unearthly delights and all that? It really is a pity that I had no intention of honoring our little bargain. I leave you your life, however, and I will refrain from dragging you down when I return home. My kind will see you again, though. Your type is destined to meet mine.
