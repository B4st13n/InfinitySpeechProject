I see. Well, as it turns out, I have met you previously. Your manner has turned out far different than I would have guessed, however. I was acquainted with your foster father, as were many others, and visited him here a number of times while you grew up. His death has been mourned across the coast, and you would do well to represent his spirit in a better fashion. Treating people with respect would be a good start.
