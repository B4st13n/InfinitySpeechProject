HA! You think me a fool? Vail would not give such a thing to a lout like you. I do not know how you came upon his name, but you obviously don't know a thing about him. Can you tell me his favorite dish? Or his mother's maiden name? I doubt you have even laid eyes on him. What was the color of his hair? Can you even name his race?
