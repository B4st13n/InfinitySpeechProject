Hmm? Oh, I suspect you mean the iron shortage? I imagine it has affected the local smithy quite a bit. Taerom is a wonderful blacksmith, but he's got a lot of time on his hands these days. His shop is still reasonably stocked, but I think he's looking for other materials to work on these days. Not sure what that might be, but he's quite adept at exotic materials. Anything else I can help you with?
