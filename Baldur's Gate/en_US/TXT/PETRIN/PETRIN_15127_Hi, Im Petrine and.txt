Hi, I'm Petrine and my folks aren't around no more and I ran away from my Uncle Bheren 'cause he's real mean. My cat's really an angel, though, and she protects me when bad things happen. Or at least she did. I can't find her now, though. I think she went back to my uncle's to get her ring. There's this ring that she loves to play with, but when I ran away I had to leave it at my nasty uncle's. If you could just get me the ring, I'm sure Angel would come back. Could you do it, oh please?
