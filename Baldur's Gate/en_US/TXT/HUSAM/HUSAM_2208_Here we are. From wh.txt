Here we are. From what I know, there's a secret entrance into the palace via the sewers. Unfortunately, it's heavily warded and guarded. That's where you come in. You'll have to disable the wards and traps. Once we're inside, we Shadow Thieves will create a diversion for the rest of you. You make your way to the election room, find out who the doppelgangers are, and kill them. Remember, make sure you know who the doppelgangers are. If you're right they'll revert to their true form; if you're wrong, you're in a heap of trouble. Here is where the location of the secret door is. It's all up to you.
