Holy kitty cacophony! You scared the bejeebbers outta me! Sure it's yer job to catch us thievers, but ye need not give me a heart attack too! Hey... you're not the guard! Yeesh! Getting me all in a tizzy when you're here for the same thing as me. Well, since you're here, howz about we work together? Just for this one heist, I mean. You keep watch while I show the stash. I know a secret here and there, but we get equal shares, okay?
