Some guy came in yesterday. Said he was part of a caravan coming from Amn to Baldur's Gate. Said his caravan got wiped out, raiders in the night so it seems. There were humans and hobgoblins attacking together he said. Can you believe that?! Human folk working with goblin scum: What has this world come to?
