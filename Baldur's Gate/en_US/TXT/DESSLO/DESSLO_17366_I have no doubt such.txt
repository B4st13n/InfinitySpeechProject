I have no doubt such a harsh request is backed by threats of violence. No matter, for I have little to give besides advice and goodwill, misplaced though it may be. I imagine you're either the cause or a victim of the carnage I heard to the north last night. It's a shame what the iron shortage has done to people's manners. You would do well to treat people you meet with a touch more respect, at least until you determine if they're a threat or not. You'll not get far if you don't make friends, though there are a couple of fellows on the road to the east that would suit your demeanor quite nicely, I am sure.
