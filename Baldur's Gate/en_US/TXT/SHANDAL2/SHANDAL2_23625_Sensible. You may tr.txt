Sensible. You may truly be as you appear, but I still must test to assure your nature. I would ask a task of you, that you retrieve an item I lost some time ago. You will be sent from this place to another place, and when you have succeeded, you will be allowed to return. Simple enough in my mind, though most things are, these days. The item is a cloak I have... misplaced. Your retrieving it will ease the burden of a busy evening. What say you?
