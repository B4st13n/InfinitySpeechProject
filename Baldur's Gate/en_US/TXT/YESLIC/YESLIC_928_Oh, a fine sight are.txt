Oh, a fine sight are you, whoever you are! Sick to death of bandits, I am! I have been cooped up the longest time, but if you've a spare mace, I'd gladly swing it for yer cause. I can do things cleric-wise as well, so I'm mind as well as muscle. By Clangeddin, a chance to right past wrongs! Can I join you?
