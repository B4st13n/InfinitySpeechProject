You would quote philosophy to one that has lived with its tenets and struggled with faith? I do not need your lectures; the sound is hollow before it leaves your lips. You do not have the strength of character to make your words ring true. Defend yourself, for there is no other way. Chaos shall be sown in their passage, in the land and the hearts and minds.
