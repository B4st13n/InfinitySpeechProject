Treacherous? Treacherous, my friend? Had the earth opened beneath my feet and spewed forth all the vermin infesting all the Nine Hells, it could not have been more treacherous. Banditry at all sides and I had naught but my feet, and how fast they moved to protect me. The singular thought that kept me on my path? This shining beacon; this plane of joy; this well-priced mead hall; call it what you will, but the Friendly Arm is home to me. Bentley! A mead on the house for the good advertising I give you, my friend!
