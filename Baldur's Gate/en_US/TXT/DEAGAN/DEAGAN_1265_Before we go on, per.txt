Before we go on, perhaps it would be well if I introduced myself. I am Deagan, employee of the Merchants' League. My master has need of services that only you would be able to provide. He is one of the owners of the Merchants' League Estate. If you were willing to speak with him in private, he would pay you 5 gold each, before you agreed to do anything for him. What do you say?
