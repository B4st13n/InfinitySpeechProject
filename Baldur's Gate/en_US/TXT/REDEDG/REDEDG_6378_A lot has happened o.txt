A lot has happened of late. Since you're my best of chums and all, I'll tell you everything I know. The Flaming Fist have taken it upon themselves to pursue the local thieving community somewhat more... aggressively than usual. I venture they are still a tad miffed by the death of their commander in chief, Scar. His replacement Angelo is a bit more... driven. If ye wish to keep to the streets, ye had best be right bloody good at the clandestine.
