The debt? You know the debt... When the evil came and took the faces of your clan, when your friends and mine became evil unmatched... you protected and fought though it pained. I could not harm... I could not strike at the clan I called family... you fought them all... though it hurt you more... I was the lucky one, and was released from the nightmare of life... the easy way. I will repay... you should know this... you should know! You have changed! You are not Durlag!
