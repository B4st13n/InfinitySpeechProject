You speak of the old like it does not matter... you know better. When the hordes came wearing the faces of friends, you fought when I would not... could not strike... I was an outsider among your clan, and you defended when all did turn against... I was released from life... but never from debt... Do not turn me away... a friend would not turn me... you are different... you are not the same... you are not Durlag! I will defend!
