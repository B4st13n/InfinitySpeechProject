My dearest Mirianne,
The road has been difficult but I have arrived safely here in Amn. I think it would be wisest if I returned by sea, however, perhaps sometime after the first snows have fallen. I trust this letter reaches you. The halfling I hired to carry it struck me as an honest enough chap.

Always and forever,
Roe...

Oh, thank you for such good tidings. Please, let me give you this ring to keep you safe in your travels.
