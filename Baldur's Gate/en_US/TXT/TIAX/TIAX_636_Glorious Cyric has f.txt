Glorious Cyric has foretold of our meeting when thou wouldst join with me. 'Tis thy duty—nay, thy DESTINY—to stand by Tiax as the world kneels before him! Er, us. To this end, I would travel with thee and do thy bidding. Later, however, your power shall add to mine, and Great Tiax will ascend to the highest office in the land. What say you? Yea or nay to the grand scheme?
