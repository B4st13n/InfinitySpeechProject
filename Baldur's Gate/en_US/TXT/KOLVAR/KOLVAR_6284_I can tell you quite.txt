I can tell you quite a lot, actually. If you haven't heard yet, Scar, second-in-command of the Flaming Fist, was assassinated while you were at Candlekeep. The Grand Duke Eltan has been infected by some sort of magical disease; so far, his healer has been unable to do anything about it. From what I've been hearing, I think that Sarevok, the new Iron Throne leader, is trying to make a grab for power in Baldur's Gate.
