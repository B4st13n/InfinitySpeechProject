I don't know you either, but that does not concern me. I know that good people are with you, and that we need help. At this point it doesn't matter whether the help comes from strangers or friends, just as long as it comes. I need someone to descend into the mines southeast of town and find what has caused our miners to go missing and our ore to become tainted. It won't solve everything, but it's the first step to easing the effects of the iron shortage.
