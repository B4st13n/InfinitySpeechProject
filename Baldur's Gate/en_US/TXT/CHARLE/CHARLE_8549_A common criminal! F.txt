A common criminal! Fine! Collect what e'er gold you can off us, but 'tis certain to be very little. We've restocked the camp thrice over because of sabotage, so we've no great wealth here. As for what we are guarding, we've no idea what we are to find; neither does it matter to us whether it's valuable or not. We are on a quest for knowledge. Move along now that you have your petty earnings. Leave us to our toil.
