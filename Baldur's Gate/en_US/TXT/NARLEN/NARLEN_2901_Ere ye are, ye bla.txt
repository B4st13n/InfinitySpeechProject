 'Ere ye are, ye blasted squeaker! Ye got dirt fer brains? Ye must, cause ye growin' something in yer ears to make ye not hear! I said nix on fightin' the guard! If no one scratches a soul case, it's just a petty theft. Ye break a watchman and they hunt ye 'cross the planes! The city'll be pins 'n needles for a week, long after the window closes on the score for tonight! We scored 300 gold this last, and that's all I'll get with you! Take it 'n go, ye Captain Hackum!
