Ye would show yer jack nasty face back here after runnin' out on us?! Ye didn'a call the warn, ye gacking mather! Guardsman caught us unknowin' blind, an' Rededge caught his blade in the softside! A rogue-duel I ask, to the dyin', 'twixt ye and me! Any o' yer friends twitch a blade and my droogs will slab the lot! I'll quiet ye good, so's Rededge can kick yer hind across the lower planes hisself!
