My last words? Last words I spoke when my body died. I like to think there was much lamenting when Grael fell, but it was but a sidebar. Durlag entrapped the beast, and his was the victory blow that is legend. A great evil, but not even the fight that is remembered in this tower. My reward is undeath. My reward is the curse of this place and the madness that claimed it.
