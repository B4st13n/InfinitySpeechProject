An evil so grand only fools chase and fight. A tanar'ri true and horrible. Its name you do not speak unless its attention you wish to bring. Long before it walked and stalked, long before even the fall of the tower. We fought along with Durlag to encase the evil away. His was the blow that won, and ours were the souls that lost. Here we stay, turned to evil and irredeemable, but heroes still and not to be killed! A cruel charity! Durlag is legend and we are a pity! Beware the gaze that is not a gaze, but a look into your soul!
