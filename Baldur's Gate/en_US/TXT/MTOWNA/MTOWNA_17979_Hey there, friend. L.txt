Hey there, friend. Looks like you and yer group are a traveling band. Well, if ye're lookin' to have some fun or maybe restock on your traveling equipment, the place to go is the fair. It's just east of town. The fair ain't too lively, with what's been going on in the mines, but you'll find what ya need.
