If you wish to force the matter, I shall yield. Do not think me such an easy foe however, as you must still retrieve the helm yourself. You did not think I had it with me, did you? Had I been wearing it, I might not have suffered the fate from which you rescued me. Search, as you will, where this note dictates. Perhaps you will find it, perhaps not. I will help you no further. Does this satiate you, or must we fight as well?
