Well, my friend Ruffie barely escaped with his life he did. Little demons jumped out of the very walls and chased him down. He'd be dead now if it weren't for the guards that came running. 'Course, them guards are dead now. Old Ruffie's around here somewhere. You ask him what he saw and he'll tell ya.
