If it is any of your concern, I am simply furious at that Sarevok man! I did not raise a fortune in this city by letting such as he stroll off with my assets! I have had dealings with the Iron Throne mercantile group for some time now, and though I did not approve of some of their... other ventures, they were at least honorable business people in their contracts with me. Now that Sarevok leads them, he has all but declared my previous deals null and void!
