Well, from what I've heard, there's some tension between the nation of Amn and the city of Baldur's Gate. I've heard that the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate think that Amn's behind all of the iron troubles along the coast. Some people have even gone as far to say that Amn might be preparing to invade. I think it's just the usual rumormongering that goes on from time to time, but then, you never know.
