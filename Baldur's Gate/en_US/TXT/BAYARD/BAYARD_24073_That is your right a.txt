That is your right and should be your intent. I will not stand in the way of anyone that understands the risk ahead, as long as you know there is a reason that no one has breached this place to any significant degree in over three hundred years. You have heard the history or you would not be here. Durlag was a disturbed man; his spirit was broken by the deaths of those around. This place reflects what happened to him and he seems to demand you understand him before you are allowed passage.
