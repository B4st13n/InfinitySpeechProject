Bah! Your kind of wanderer has already taken my most precious possession. The life of my brother was wasted following a group like yours around. That you have come to steal whatever is left is nothing more than a confirmation of what I already knew; those that wander are either scoundrels, thieves, or fools. I leave it up to you to decide which of these YOU are. Get out of my home.
