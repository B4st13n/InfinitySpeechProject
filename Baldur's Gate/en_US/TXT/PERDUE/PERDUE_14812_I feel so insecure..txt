I feel so insecure. Nobody 'ere really likes me. They're always bullying me and pushing me around. My therapist says it's because I still 'ave some unresolved issues with my father. I just don't have the heart to tell her that 'e was killed in a bizarre fishing accident when I was only three. *sigh* I just wish people would stop picking on me, you know?
