I find your manner displeasing, though I suppose it has been your trials that have made you this way. I am an aide of Scar's. His instructions were to follow you and see that you don't get into more trouble than you are worth. You seem capable of handling yourself, but I still think you would benefit from a visit to the Flaming Fist headquarters.
