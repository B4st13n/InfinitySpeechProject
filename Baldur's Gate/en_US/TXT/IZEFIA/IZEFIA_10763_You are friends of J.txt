You are friends of Jaheira, are you not? She is of the druidic order that follows Seniyad, one of the three archdruids. Well, I do not share their philosophy! It is because of their pacifist doctrines that atrocities against nature continue, like the fool to the northeast that entraps animals and enslaves them for his petty tasks! As a Shadow Druid, I fight so that nature is left untouched; there is no room for society to live alongside! This must be enforced through fear, and the removal of the naive taint Jaheira and her kind have sown!
