Okay...? You aren't going to do a thing? Wow. You... you must have incredible faith in my will to live. No one has ever shown such trust in me, not ever! Not even mumsey! Thank you so much for your quiet faith! I choose to live! I CHOOSE TO LIVE! Oh, no! I have to get home before mumsey finds the note! She has no stomach for such things. I'll have Jeeves double her usual cocktails and tell her of my new resolve! Thank you so much. Tra la! Life is grand once again!
