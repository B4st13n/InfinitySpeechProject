You look the sort that like flashy weapons and trinkets. You should go see Thalantyr west of town. Sure he's grumpy, and he might even have his "pets" attack you, but he usually calls them off if you take the time to talk to him. He's got a lot of magical wares for sale, though he acts like he's doing you a favor taking your gold.
