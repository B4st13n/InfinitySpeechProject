You did good, kid, especially after Erik started firing those arrows at ya. I'm sure your father would be proud. You should go talk to the Gatewarden if you want some experience in fighting with a group of people. You can find him just south of here. Out there, it can be pretty important to know how to fight with allies at your side.
