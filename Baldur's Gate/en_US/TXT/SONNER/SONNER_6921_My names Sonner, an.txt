My name's Sonner, and I'm a simple fisherman. Lately, a young priestess of Umberlee has been causin' me and my friends a lot of trouble. Seems she wants revenge against us for killing her mother. Well, we had to. A Talos priest promised his favor upon us if we did. Caught between gods, we are. You are as well.
