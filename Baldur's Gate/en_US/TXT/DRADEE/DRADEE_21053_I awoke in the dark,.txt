I awoke in the dark, several hours later. At first, I believed I was dead, but when I tried to rise, the pain in my head dispelled that myth. There was blood everywhere. So much blood. The body of the lycanthrope I had killed lay several feet away, draped over Galan's ravaged corpse. I retched at the sight of my friend, so cruelly killed.
