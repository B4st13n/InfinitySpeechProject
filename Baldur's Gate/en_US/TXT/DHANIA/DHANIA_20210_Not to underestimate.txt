Not to underestimate you or anything, but have you not noticed that you are a little bit late?! The Iron Throne is in a shambles, and I simply don't want to stand around and watch it crumble about my ears! That Sarevok and his enormous ambitions have left us in the lurch, and there is nothing for me to do now but cover my losses and run. He has used us all to get where he wished, and now is on the verge of becoming a Grand Duke! He would have made a fabulous ally, if he had not cared so little for anyone but himself.
