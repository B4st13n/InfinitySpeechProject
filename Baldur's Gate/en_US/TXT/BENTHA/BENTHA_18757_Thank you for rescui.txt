Thank you for rescuing me. I am Bentha, and yes you could call me a witch, for I do use magic. However, I have no intentions of killing the livestock or "seducing" the young men. Zordral is an old enemy of mine, one who has caused me and my family great pain over the years. If you had not walked in at that moment, I would have been killed. I must thank you again. Is there anything that I can do to help you?
