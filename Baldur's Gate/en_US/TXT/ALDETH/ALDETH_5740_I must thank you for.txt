I must thank you for saving my consortium! I will reward all of you greatly for what you have done for me. I hope what I give you now is reward enough. This sword is a family heirloom, and could be useful if you were ever to run into those shapeshifting creatures again. Know that if ever you are in trouble, you can come to my estate.
