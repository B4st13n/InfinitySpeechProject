Thank you so much, my friends. This should suffice for privacy. I'm sorry for all of this hiding and skulking, but there are dire events afoot. You know that I am one of the principal shareholders of the Merchants' League. Well, I share ownership of the company with two others: Irlentree and Zorl Miyar, two very distinguished gentlemen. When I returned from my hunting trip—thanks to you, I might add—I found that my two partners had undergone some profound changes, nothing physical or overt, but something far more sinister.
