Sarevok is the foul spawn that surely did the deed! He craves the power of the Iron Throne, but for what purpose I do not know! He throws away gold like it was copper, and uses our best laid plans to inflame governments instead of bargaining for wealth! He's in line to become a Grand Duke because of his efforts to fight his OWN chaos, but I doubt his coronation will stop his lust for carnage. Who are YOU, by the way? What are you doing here?
