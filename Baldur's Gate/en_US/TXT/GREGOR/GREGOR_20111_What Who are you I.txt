What? Who are you? I speak of Sarevok, the new self-proclaimed "leader" of the Iron Throne. My father Brunos was barely a day dead when Sarevok made his claim, and now everything is crumbling. I am sure he orchestrated the whole thing so he could gain control, but if he wanted to run the organization, why does he act as though he does not care for it? I have no idea, but I will put a blade in his belly before the day is through, regardless. Who did you claim to be?
