It is a simple game. You get as far as the front gate, you are worthy to have served the Water Queen and may take what you came for. If you do not get there, well, you shall be beyond worrying about it. Oh, and if you think our waveservants may just let you pass? ATTENTION! The Sea Queen demands a test! If these intruders live... the ranks will be CLEANSED!
