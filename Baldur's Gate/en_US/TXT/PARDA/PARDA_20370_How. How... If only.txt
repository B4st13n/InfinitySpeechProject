How. How... If only I knew! Go around, search about. You have been away for a time; perhaps your eyes will see things that we cannot. We have been here too long; we are blind to the malignancies for they have crept up so slowly and absorbed themselves into our gaze. But they are there. My eyes can't see them, my ears can't hear them, but all that is in me screams with the knowledge that they are there! Now hush, no one must know that we've been talking.
