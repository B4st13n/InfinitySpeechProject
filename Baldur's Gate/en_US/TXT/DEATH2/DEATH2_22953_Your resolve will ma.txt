Your resolve will make for a good epitaph. This IS the last, and here I shall crumble your bones to dust. You have discovered nothing that will not be silenced with your death. I will give you pain unlike you have ever known. I will not even risk my trinket on you. You will know the honor of dying by my own hand.
