It is not gold I owe, but honor! Your clan was a refuge to me, to my family until... you fought them off when I could not strike my... my children changed to doubles... you... you have no need of wealth. We waded through dragon hoards and left with empty pockets, you and I. You have changed much since you... since I... death... death took us both! You are not Durlag! He valued family over all! You are invaders! I will repel you and he will rest easy! I will repay!
