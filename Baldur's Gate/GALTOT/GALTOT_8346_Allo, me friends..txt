 'Allo, me friends. You've the look of the well-armed wanderer, which means you *burp* either do the fool's work of dungeon slumming or the easy labor of the blade-and-night man. Aye! Either way, you've items you've liberated from their previous owners. I can help you on that point. If you've something a touch too "known" for a store to buy, I'll take it off your handsâ€”at a slightly reduced figure, of course.
