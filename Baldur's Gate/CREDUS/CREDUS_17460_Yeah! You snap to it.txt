Yeah! You snap to it, just like I had to. It's gonna be great being the boss for a change! No more standing around for hours guarding stupid papers and garbage. It's not as if we need guards for Tazok's tent. No one is dumb enough to cross him. Anyway, you'll be my helper from now on. Maybe tonight you should guard Tazok's tent. We'll break you in so he don't do it. You just make sure nothing goes missing, or your head will be next.
