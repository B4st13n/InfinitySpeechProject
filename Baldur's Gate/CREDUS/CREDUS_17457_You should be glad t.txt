You should be glad to get me! I'm tough, I'm dependable, and... I also know what it's like to be the new guy. Had to fight to get respect. At first they didn't want me guarding Tazok's tent. They said I would fall asleep, or blab about the papers. Well, I know better, and I proved it! So you just count your lucky sheep that I'm on duty, 'cuz maybe I'll put in a good word for you. Or maybe not! I'll decide later.
