Oh, you don't want to be talking to him. Tazok is kinda scary. I do a good job guarding his tent so he's only smacked me once, but if you talk too much, he might hurt you worse. Especially if you interrupt him reading his important papers. Just guard them and shut up, that's what I say. I better go. Talking about Tazok is bad for your health.
