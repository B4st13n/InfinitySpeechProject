Now isn't this strange? You are now my friend! This is quite the predicament. I've been hired to kill you, yet now I love you. What am I to do? I know, I know! I will tell you want you want to hear, and then I shall kill you. Does this satisfy you? No matter, let me begin: Once, there were three pigs who had built a house of iron. This house had brought them fortune and comfort, but it was now threatened by the big bad wolf! So the three pigs hired out a small man named Nimbul. "Nimbul," they said, "You must kill this wolf for us. If you do this, you will be given much gold to line your pockets." So Nimbul set out to kill the wolf, but then something happened that he never expected: Nimbul fell in love with the wolf! So now, to Nimbul's sorrow, he must carry out this order and end the wolf's life. Goodbye!
