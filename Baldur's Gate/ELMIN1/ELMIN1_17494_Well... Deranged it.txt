Well... Deranged it is then. I shall leave thee, if that is what thou dost wish. Heed my parting words, however, and treat strangers with a touch more respect. At least until thou hast determined whether they are a threat, and perhaps more powerful than they seem. Do not dally about on these roads for long. Someone with thy manners will not last an eve. The Friendly Arm Inn is to the north. They extend sanctuary even to such as thee.
