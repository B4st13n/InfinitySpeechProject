New deckhands be yer tale? Har, I've got more deckhands than days o' the year and I sure as salt didn't go beggin' about fer more... Ah, but ne'ermind that. I like yer face and if ye want to wash me decks and cook me slop that desperately, I can't see no harm in it. We'll just throw the lazier ones o'erboard once we leave port, har! Go on now, wander 'bout the building till we're ready to put ya ta work on my ship.
