No? Please say I have not offended you in some manner! Ah well, at least I will have the satisfaction of knowing that the glorious deeds you will surely accomplish are in some measure due to the goodwill I have shown today. Out, all of you, out! My coffers can ill afford any more charity! Thank you, everyone, for your patronage. Now out!
