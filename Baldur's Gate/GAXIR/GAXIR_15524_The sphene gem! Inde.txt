The sphene gem! Indeed, then... you are more than you appear. Someday, you must journey further through the muck and mire of this place for it will tell you as much or more than all of fabled Candlekeep... Like yourself, this city is more than it appears. There are cities below cities, dreams beneath dreams, the past laying buried beneath the crushing weight of the present... Go now, wanderer, for the time will come when you must walk through the darkness to find the light.
