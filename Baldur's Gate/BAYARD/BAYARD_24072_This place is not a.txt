This place is not a ruin; it is not open to the ages. This place was designed to keep people out, or to kill them. Even the simplest of doors seem locked with wardstones. If you enter here, you had best be prepared to succeed or die. Ahh, you have inspired a lecture from me, but your life is yours to do with what you will. I must go. Good luck to you; I do wish you well.
