A sensible response to what is ahead. You do not often see the cautionary approach from an adventurer. Of course, that is why you do not often meet OLD adventurers. If you do decide to return, please keep in mind that there is a reason that no one has breached this place to any significant degree in over three hundred years. You have heard the history or you would not be here. Durlag was a disturbed man; his spirit was broken by the deaths of those around. This place reflects what happened to him and he seems to demand you understand him before you are allowed passage.
