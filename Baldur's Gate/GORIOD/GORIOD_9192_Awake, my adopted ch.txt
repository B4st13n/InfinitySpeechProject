Awake, my adopted child. Awake and face the terrible tests ahead of thee. Speak not, for I have but little time. This place is the Between. 'Tis not so much real, as it is a dream, though not so much a dream, as it is real. That which should be dead can cast its tentacles here, and your life is already wound within its grasping limbs. There is always hope, however, and your actions here shall determine the grip with which you are held. I can tell you no more of your true lineage than I did in life, but you will learn much here. You must pursue several items, for they are key to who you are. A Talon is the first, followed by the horn of great beast, a candle of light, a dagger of bone, a potion of blood and tears, and a blackened skull. I must leave you now, for 'tis a great strain to remain in the Between. No ordinary mortal can remain for long, so I must leave you to your search. I wish I could say I am leaving you here alone, but you are not. Seek wisely and true, and remember ye well: 'Tis often the journey that shapes the child, and not so much where they must go.
