Eh? Who's this then? More intrepid fools on the road to a beating? I suppose ye need the healing or some such to repair whatever damage ye marched headlong into. Well, the Provider provides and the Provider protects, but don't ye go messing up her handiwork anytime soon! And stand ye away from them barrels of ale! Littleman watches over all, and he'll turn you out on your ear if you damage a cork in his spiritual home.
