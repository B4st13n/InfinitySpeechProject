Hey, I remember you. Your father was Gorion, wasn't it? You should see all of the strange fellows who've come to the keep these days. Three men work for that mercantile organization, Iron Throne I think they called it. They've been meeting with the two spookiest people I've ever seen. It's like clockwork. Every day, they meet on the third floor to discuss who knows what kind of dastardly plots. Ha ha, I'm sure they're just boring old merchants counting their money.
