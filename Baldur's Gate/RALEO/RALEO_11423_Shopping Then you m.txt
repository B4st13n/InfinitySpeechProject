Shopping? Then you must stop by Feldepost's Inn. They have a number of trophy items for sale, some are even magical in nature. Best you bring gold aplenty though; they are not cheap. If you really have coins to spare, I'd suggest going west of the city and seeking out Thalantyr. He has a shop in his keep, though he does not welcome visitors. Trust me, you will want to speak with him immediately if you go there. Wandering about his shop without permission is downright deadly. I think he likes scaring folks a bit. Anything else you need?
