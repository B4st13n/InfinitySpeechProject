An adventurer, eh? Well, if you are up to the task, I hear there are strange things in the Ulcaster School ruins southeast of town. I would nae go down there unless you are quite sure of your abilities though. Many a well-meaning fellow has gone and not come back. Only for those adept in battle. Other than that, I know that the lady Mirianne has been awaiting news of her husband for some time. He was to come up from Amn but is overdue. I know she would be grateful for any news. She lives on the east edge of town if you find anything. Anything else you would like to know of?
