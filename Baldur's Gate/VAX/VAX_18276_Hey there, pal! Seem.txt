Hey there, pal! Seems like your little party's wandered a bit off the beaten path. Well, that's too bad for you, 'cause you've had the misfortune of meeting the fastest draw in the west. See that man over yonder? His name's Zal, and he's the fastest dart thrower that has ever walked the Sword Coast. Now, if I were you, I wouldn't want to test the patience of such a man. So why don't you do the wise thing and hand over all your money? Otherwise, you're going to be in a heap of trouble.
