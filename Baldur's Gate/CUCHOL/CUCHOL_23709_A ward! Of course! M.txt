A ward! Of course! My friends, I have been trapped here for too long. Think of my reputation! "Cuchol," they'll say, "what kind of mystical magic man are you?" Then I'll say, "It's not my fault! It's that stupid ice!" Then they'll say, "You're a loser, Cuchol. A real fool, if you catch my drift." Can't you see? My reputation! I must have that ward! I must escape!
