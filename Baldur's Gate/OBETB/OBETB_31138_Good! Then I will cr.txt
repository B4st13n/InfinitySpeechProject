Good! Then I will create some more illusory monsters. This time I'll create some xvarts. Xvarts are primarily mountain dwelling creatures, but they can be often found on the Coastway. Also, if you would like to use that wand in Osprey's possession, then simply tap, hold, and then release on its icon in her inventory. This will bring up a description of the wand. There will be a button at the bottom of that page that says "Identify." Press that button to identify the wand, and you will then be able to place it in Osprey's Quick Item slot where she can make use of it in combat. Whenever a Mage in your party has the Identify spell memorized, just remember to put the item in his inventory and repeat the instructions that I've given you.
