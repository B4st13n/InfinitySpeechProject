I think that's enough fighting for the day. You're starting to look pretty tired and my magical abilities have been stretched to very near their limit. I'm going to teleport you outside now, and I think it would be good if you went and talked to your foster father, Gorion. You won't be able to reenter these cellars once I teleport you out. That's for your own safety as sometimes the aftermath of my illusions can be dangerous.
