Am I... Durlag? You have cause to wonder... you have seen traps and illusions and phantoms... but the spirit of Durlag has long since passed... to whatever fate the dark veil holds... this place... this place is his fear... his anger... his torment. You wish to conquer this place? You will have to understand what created it... remember well what you have already seen... or leave now and live life long and natural... three paths lead away... all must be taken...
