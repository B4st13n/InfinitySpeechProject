Never has fallen to Faer√ªn a more bungled thief! Wakin' Gantolandan brought more guard than rats to cheese. Or mayhaps cats to rats! I don't fancy being the rodent in the mix! Not a gem fer the trouble neither. If this be common knowin' I'll get no rest in guild. Neither ye, 'cause many brethren will query Alatos why he sought ye. Ye no proved yer worth this night past.
