I've had some time to think about it. I couldn't go forward and I couldn't go back the way we came. That thing in there might even know I'm out here. I doubt it cares, but something it said made me think. The Mirror of Opposition it used must be very powerful... maybe it's powerful enough to do the same thing to the demon knight itself. The legends I've heard is that they have some resistances, but who knows with magic? The rules are not always carved in stone.
