Friends! I can tell you quite a bit about the goings-on in the region. For one, there has been a lot of trouble along the Coast Way. Bandits have been attacking caravans, but strangely, they have been stealing iron, rather than gold or other valuables. On a curiously similar vein, the iron mines of Nashkel have been the source of some mischief. Someone, or something has been killing the miners who delve there. There are many rumors as to the significance of these events, chief of which is that Amn is trying to shake up the region before embarking on an invasion of Baldur's Gate. I can't say whether any of this holds any validity.
