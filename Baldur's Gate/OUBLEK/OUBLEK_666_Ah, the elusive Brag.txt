Ah, the elusive Brage. Dead, as he should be! No matter, it would have been a short trial, and he'd have been executed anyway. Now as a last indignity he'll be put in an unmarked grave like some common thief. A great loss to the guard to be sure, but there's no room for those who don't respect the law. You've earned your 250 gold on this one.
