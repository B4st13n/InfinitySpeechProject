No, say not another word. I would not think of making you wait but a moment for your just reward. When council told me that they had procured GREYWOLF to rid the woods of the bandit Tonquin, I knew we could expect swift justice. I would not have predicted success this quickly, but who else could it be striding into town looking, ah, looking as you do? Please accept this meager sum of 200 gold pieces, as well as the heartfelt thanks of all of Nashkel.
