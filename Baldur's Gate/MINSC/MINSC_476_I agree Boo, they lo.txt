I agree Boo, they look to be friendly. Greetings, we are Minsc and Boo. We have traveled far to explore this land, but now my charge Dynaheir has been taken from us. 'Twas gnolls, and once we have tracked them I will beat sense into their heads until they release her. Accompany us, and bards will sing the deeds of Minsc and Boo... and friends.
