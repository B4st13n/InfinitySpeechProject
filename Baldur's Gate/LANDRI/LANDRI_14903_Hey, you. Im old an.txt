Hey, you. I'm old and my feet are tired. If you could run back to Beregost and bring me a wine bottle from my cellar, I'll give you 75 gold pieces. It's the house right to the west of the Jovial Juggler Inn. If you step on a spider or two while there I'll up the reward, though I'll need proof. Bring my husband's old boots too, if you please.
