Hey, I've got a teeny bit of a spider infestation happening in my cellar in Beregost. I was on my way to the Gate to get some poison but this would be a lot easier on my legs, to be honest. You'll know the house when you see it. It's right to the west of the Jovial Juggler Inn. Bring back their bodies to prove you've done the job and I'll give you 100 gold pieces. If you could, please bring my husband's old boots and my ol' bottle of wine back as well, and I'll throw in something extra.
