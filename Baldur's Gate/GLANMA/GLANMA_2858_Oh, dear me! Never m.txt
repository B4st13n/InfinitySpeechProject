Oh, dear me! Never mention that to master Oberan. He has never liked Piergeiron Paladinstar and won't have a servant not good enough for him. I should not do this, but I need the extra help, so consider yourself hired. We've important guests at the moment, so you had best stay in the background. Clean the rooms in the east wing, and leave the west for me.
