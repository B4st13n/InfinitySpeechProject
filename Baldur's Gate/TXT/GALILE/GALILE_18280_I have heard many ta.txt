I have heard many talk such as you, and if that is honestly your belief, then so be it. There is little I could do to change your mind, even if I wished to waste the energy on trying. It is a shame, though. Such interesting times are ahead. I suppose some of the excitement is in the uncertainty, but I prefer to take whatever advantage I can. My patron is quite rich from my efforts. Regardless, I wish you well on your journeys.
