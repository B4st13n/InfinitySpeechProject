Oh! I had meant to tell you but it slipped my mind. I fear I have been somewhat scatterbrained since this has begun. Duke Eltan anticipated your need for a little assistance, so he arranged for a mercenary guild to send along some hired help. A strange mix, to be sure, but I am certain they will serve with you well. All seem quite skilled in their... uh... niches. Introductions are in order, I believe.
