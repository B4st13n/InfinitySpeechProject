That is unfortunate... that you had to resort to killing. I believe you, and your reasons seem valid, but I still cannot agree with what you have done. If you had presented your case with evidence or proof of some sort instead of simply killing them, events might have happened differently. As it is, you are a criminal in the eyes of your enemies AND the law. Still, it would seem that someone wishes to secure your fate, even though you ARE guilty. Much more evidence points to you, much more than you admit to. I am not prone to suspicions, but I would almost believe that someone intended those men dead and was going to blame you regardless. If this is so, then those men, evil though they were, were not your true enemies, and this does not bode well for the Sword Coast. I will help you escape so you may continue your crusade, but remember that the authorities will not believe your accusations without proof, especially now that you are an accused murderer.
