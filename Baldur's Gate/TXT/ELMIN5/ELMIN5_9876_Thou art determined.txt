Thou art determined to be confrontational, aren't thee? So be it. I will leave thee to whatever fate that thou dost carve for thyself. I will extend the courtesy of a warning though; thy manner may come natural to thee, but obeying thine impulses is not always the best course. Being true to thyself is only wise if that is truly the self thou dost wish to become. I lecture too long and thine interest fades. Off with thee, to whatever fate will have thee.
