The common folk? I don't know anyone that likes to be referred to in that way. I think most would tell you that the nobles are much less interesting than the "common folk." We are free to go where we wish and speak to whomever we please. Nobles must worry about being seen with the "wrong sort," or being caught in the "wrong place." Many a tale has been spilled about the hapless efforts of noble fools trying to cover their exploits. Many a tale in this here bar actually.
