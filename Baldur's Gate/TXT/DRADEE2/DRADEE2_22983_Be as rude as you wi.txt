Be as rude as you wish. For your help earlier, I will give you this advice. I have discovered a series of caves, warrens really, that the wolf monstrosities live in. There is a hidden door in this hut. The caves will lead you to the ship where the chieftain's woman is. I warn you now: The way is fraught with peril. Head east through the caves and you may find the exit. Hurry friends! I thank you for my freedom. Perhaps we shall meet again someday.
