This is perhaps not the largest of settlements, but you can rest assured that Taerom Thunderhammer is the best smith in all the planes. You'll not find a finer set of armor than you can get here, and you'll not find a group of workers more devoted to their employer. More importantly, you'll not find a group of workers more willing to bash the teeth of anyone who badmouths Taerom! Tread carefully... and politely.
