You gotta go? Yeah, I suppose you do. Okay, I tell you how to get out okay and safe. They gonna watch the gate for you, but you go by the east beach and look along the wall. There's a hole that I get out through sometimes. Mommay never knew about it, even though I would bring back flowers for her. You'd better go fast. I try to make them think you went another way, okay? Please try not to hurt many people; they just want to be left alone, mostly.
