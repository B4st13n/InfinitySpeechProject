Aye, I guess, but I'll not be long about it. The acolytes I mentioned, they stay with Thaldorn on the fifth floor. Six of them, there are, and their madness comes in pairs: two priests, two mages, two hardened thugs. But there is something wrong about them. If they were here for the simple joys of a pretty coin, I'd have no quarrel with them. But no, they would not deign to be so human. There is something more, some secret agenda and I know not what... Ack, even now I can feel their pestilential eyes upon me. Your lucre can keep me here no longer, I'm afraid.
