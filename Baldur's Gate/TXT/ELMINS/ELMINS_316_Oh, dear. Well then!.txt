Oh, dear. Well then! Don't dawdle in the woods too long, my young friend. It is dangerous out at night, and I would think that thou would like a FRIENDLY ARM to help GUIDE thee. Yes, <SIRMAAM>, a FRIENDLY ARM IN-deed would be useful. Here's a little something for thy trouble... that thou will undoubtedly encounter. I shall possibly see thee again in thy travels. Goodbye and, well, good luck.
