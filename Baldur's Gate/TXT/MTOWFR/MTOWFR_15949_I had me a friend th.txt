I had me a friend that asked one o' them smarty-pants mages why they didn't just conjure great walls o' iron out o' the air. That there mage looked my friend square in the eyes, and asked him how secure he'd feel if the guard were outfitted in weapons and armor that was dispellable with nary a wink. I hate magic. Makes me nervous.
