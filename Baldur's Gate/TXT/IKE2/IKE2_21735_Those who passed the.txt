Those who passed the wards were confronted with the fruits of the paranoia that CONSUMED Durlag. In this sitting room alone are some of the most fiendish DEVICES OF DEATH known to man! Upon the wall hung a picture that, before it was RIPPED from its frame, caused those that looked upon it to freeze in their tracks for ALL TIME! Look with HORROR upon this hapless soul!
