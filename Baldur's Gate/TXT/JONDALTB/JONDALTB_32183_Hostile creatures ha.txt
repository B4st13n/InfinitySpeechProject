Hostile creatures have red circles around their feet. Tapping within the circle will direct you to attack me. You can switch weapons using the Quick Weapons icons. The weapon outlined in green is the current weapon. Since you're a Monk, attacking with your fists (empty Quick Slot) can kill your opponentâ€”but you don't have to worry about that with me. If you have magical abilities, try casting a spell at me by tapping on the star icon at the bottom of the screen. Tap on one of the spells that come up and cast it on whichever target you want. I just hope you haven't used up your abilities for the day.
