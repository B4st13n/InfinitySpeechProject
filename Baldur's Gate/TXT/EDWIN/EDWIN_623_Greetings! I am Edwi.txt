Greetings! I am Edwin and I wish to... Oh, my. (She has allies already!) It would seem that the quarry I would have hired you to find is already within your midst! Dynaheir is not to be trusted, and I urge you to cast her from your party. If you will not, at least allow me to join you as well. I am a wizard of some renown, and as such I will not fall prey to the deceitful guile of one such as she.
