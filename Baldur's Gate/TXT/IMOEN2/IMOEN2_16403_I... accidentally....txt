I... accidentally... read a letter on his desk the other day. Can't remember exactly what it said, but he might still have... It might be on his... his body. Anyway, I'm not gonna let you wander around out here all alone. Never let a friend down, no, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Stick with you until you say otherwise, I will!
