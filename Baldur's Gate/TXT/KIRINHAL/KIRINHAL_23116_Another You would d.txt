Another? You would do this? Oh, you are deliciously wicked. Perhaps there is a way. Take this lock of my hair and find someone near this place. Tell them it is a lock of nymph's hair. If you can pass it to another mortal male and they accept it, they will be accepting part of me. That will free me and imprison him here for the rest of his life. They must be within the tower for the enchantment to work. Such an act will undoubtedly reflect in your karma as the magics of this place are powerful indeed, but I will be oh sooo grateful. You'll like me when I'm grateful. Will you do this for me? Will you? So what if some fool starves to death here?
