It is as I feared. Listen to me, we haven't much time. The ones who stole the dagger from you are the same that released the demon that killed me granda'. Me granda' was killed by a tanar'ri, a nabassu to be precise. The one who stole it from you is a member of a cult that worships this beast as a god. Many centuries ago, when me granda' adventured with Durlag, they fell foul of the tanar'ri, which had been released on our plane by the cult. Durlag and me granda' defeated the tanar'ri, though granda' was mortally wounded, and they entrapped the demon's essence in a dagger. Me da' later found a way to destroy the dagger and the beast within, but tragedy befell Durlag before he could send the dagger to me clan.
