First of all, my name is Degrodel. I can only assume that you're <CHARNAME>, the adventurer who has been stirring up so much trouble in the recent past. Now that introductions are done, let us get down to business. My task is very simple. Some years ago, an evil band of mercenaries were all petrified while trying to break into the home of Ramazith. For those of you with a limited vocabulary, petrified means "turned to stone." Anyhow, one of those adventurers had in his possession an item of power: the Helm of Balduran. Ramazith didn't know this at the time and so, after turning them all to stone, he simply sold their bodies to an art collector living in the heart of Baldur's Gate. What I would like you to do is find these statues, turn them back to flesh, and take the item.
