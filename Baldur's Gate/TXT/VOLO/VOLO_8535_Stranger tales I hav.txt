Stranger tales I have told, but none are as fresh in my mind as this one, which is also fresh from the happening as well! It would seem that the orchestrators of the ever vexing iron shortage supplied themselves and their allies with ore mined from a secret location, and while the coast was in turmoil they built quite the power base at the aforementioned mine. A group of heroes, for they can only be called such, lay siege to the encampment and ultimately flooded out the evil conspirators in a rushing torrent of water and justice, though not before securing the release of some several dozen enslaved workers. A serious blow, I am sure, to whatever fiendish plot is brewing in our fair land.
