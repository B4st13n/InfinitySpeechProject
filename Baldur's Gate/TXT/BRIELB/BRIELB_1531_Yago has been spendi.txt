Yago has been spending his nights at the Low Lantern. It's just another despicable whorehouse disguised as something classier. Yago has been spending all of his time there since he left me. He's rented out a room somewhere on the ship. Just find his spellbook and bring it to me. I should be able to reverse the curse if I had the formula.
