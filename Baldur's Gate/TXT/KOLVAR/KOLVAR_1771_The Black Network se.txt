The Black Network sends its regards. Since my associates haven't yet, I'll introduce myself: I'm Kolvar. I've come down from Darkhold to see how things have been faring. Semmemon isn't very pleased at how the Zhentish name has been being falsely used. We have a bad enough rep as it is, without all the rest of the crap that's been going on down here. So tell me, is it true that you killed the leaders of the Iron Throne?
