The skull of Kereph... He was a priest here long ago, and Tymora blessed him greatly. Too greatly, perhaps. Made some people jealous... Made him some enemies... Then one night we found him dead, his body torn and broken, his head gone. No one ever found the killer. No one ever asked. It is best to leave that sort of justice to Tymora. Perhaps this is her forgiveness, no? Go well in the luck of Tymora, stranger. Find Ghorak, for he should now be cured of his affliction.
