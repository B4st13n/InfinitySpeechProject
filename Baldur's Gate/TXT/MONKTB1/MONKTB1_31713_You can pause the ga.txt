You can pause the game at any time by tapping on the clock face in the lower left. Unpausing occurs the same way. Pausing is most useful during combat where it gives you the time to carefully orchestrate your party's attack. While paused, issue your commands. When you unpause the game, your characters will obey the orders you have given them. If you do not pause often, you will find the entire game very difficult to play.
