I'm afraid it is not that simple, though it never is, is it? You see, you have been allowed into the inner chambers of my guild, you have met me, and you have seen a number of other members. While this knowledge might not directly benefit you, if made known to the guard it would certainly harm me. I submit to you that I cannot allow this information to leave with someone... not of good standing with the guild. Your choice is somewhat limited in this manner. Choose wisely.
