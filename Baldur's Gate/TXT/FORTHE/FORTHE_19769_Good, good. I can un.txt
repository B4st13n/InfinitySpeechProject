Good, good. I can understand the motivations of these people and tales. I'm sure I could write a fine ballad about these things, as I know their subjects well and true. Unfortunately, songs about such things are not likely to increase my tips or inspire my listeners to applause. If I were more philosophical I might realize this as a flaw within myself, but as it is I am sure it is someone else's fault. Take your money and leave me, I don't think I can use you after all.
