I am Shandalar, and I am the default benefactor of this place. My home is here, as are my major interests. I take interest in whoever comes this way, and you are very interesting indeed. I should like you to perform a task for me. A small thing, really, but something I do not have time for myself. I need for you to go to... another place and retrieve an item of mine. Very simple, and if you succeed, I will think all the better of you. What say you to this?
