Spare me your false pretensions and manners, I see through them as I see through light and day! And save your disgusting innocence and ignorance! You know me well and true, though we have not met in person to personal manner! My name, most foul whelp, is Shandalar! Yes, I see the dim lights of recognition in your eyes! Like a bolt from the sky, though I get ahead of myself. You did slaughter that which I held most dear! For shaaame!
