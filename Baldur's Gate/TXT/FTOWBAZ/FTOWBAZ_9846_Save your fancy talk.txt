Save your fancy talk for the prim little ladies at county fairs, I ain't got a use for it! Is everything all right you ask? You've got some nerve, you do. I had a brother in that Iron Throne building, I did. He said they were nothing but merchants, but now he acts all strange. Ever since that Sarevok took over, and I don't think that bodes well for the rest of us if he is made Duke. So don't ask me if everything is all right.
