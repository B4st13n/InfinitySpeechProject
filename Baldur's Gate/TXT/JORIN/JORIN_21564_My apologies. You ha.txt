My apologies. You have not offended me. I only wish to protect my people from the disease of too much hope. Everyone knows that you go to fight the evil wolves. I have fought them often and I know their strengths. I do not think that you can destroy them. Perhaps you are great warriors, as the villagers believe. As they want to believe. If so, I will respect your abilities and wish you luck. Perhaps you only wish to be heroes. If so, I respect your courage but doubt that you will survive the day.
