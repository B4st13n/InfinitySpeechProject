Mendas? I do not know this name. I had hoped... one of our kin left the home some time ago, and I thought he might have send you. Selaad was his name, and he was our chieftain. I know not Balduran either. He was not among our founders; he never belong as we. The wreck I have not seen for year upon year. But know where it is, I do.
