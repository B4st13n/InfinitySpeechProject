They did not wish to become as we are. They fought our mothers' grandmothers without thought, and would not reason. Balduran led them, and because of his leadership many on both sides died. I do not know his fate, only that he killed many, and so the ancestors left him to his sinking ship. He would not belong, and now we know not to ask. You will know peace with us, because we do not wish to harm our saviors. You who would help us to leave.
