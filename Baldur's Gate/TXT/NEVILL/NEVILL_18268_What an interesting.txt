What an interesting proposal. Indeed, we could protect you from any monsters you might encounter or any ill-willed travelers along the way. It would be possible, even likely, except for one minor detail: Ahem, you see, we be bandits here. Cutthroats, ne'er-do-wells, tommyknockers, and such ilk. We could protect you from all but ourselves, our own urges and greed... In truth, that greed overwhelms us now. Attack men, that we might satiate it!
