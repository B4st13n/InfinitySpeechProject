My husband had to make a sudden business trip to Amn and I'm so worried for him. "Mirianne," he always said, "Mirianne, who knows the road better than old Roe?" But the highways just aren't as safe as they once were and there hasn't been a messenger from Amn here in months. Could you keep your eyes open along the southern roads and let me know if you find anything?
