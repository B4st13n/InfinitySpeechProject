There's been something killing peoples in and 'round the farms here. Zombies or something. I can understands if you can't stomach the task but, just between you an' me real personal-likes, I don't know who else is gonna do it... All of us haves been goin' for a week now without sleep. We've counted twenty zombies or so, so keep track as you kill 'em, if that's what you plans on doing. Once you got 'em all, come back here and I'll gives you the 150 gold pieces that some of us have pooled together.
