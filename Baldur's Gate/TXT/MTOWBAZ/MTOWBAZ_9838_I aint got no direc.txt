I ain't got no directions for you, except to get out of my way. I ain't staying another moment in this town now that the roads are clearing up. I knew that Scar guy that ran the Flaming Fist for Eltan, and now he's dead. His replacement Angelo is a puppet for Sarevok, and Sarevok is just plain nasty. Nobles like him, but I don't care how much Amn deserves it, I ain't going to war.
