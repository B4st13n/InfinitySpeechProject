You again?! I should think you wouldn't show your face around here after absconding with my pantaloons! Had a good long talk to that management about you. He dared to try to avoid responsibility by saying that he had no laundry staff. I gave him a thorough dressing down, but he stuck by his story. Left me in quite the tizzy, I assure you. Get out of my presence; I'll have nothing more to do with any of the lot of you!
