If you are interested, friend, I am a Greycloak from Evereska. It is my duty to watch over the political events of the human nations along our borders. From what I have learned so far, there is some sort of mercantile organization known as the Iron Throne that has been trying to cause turmoil along the Sword Coast. To what end, I could not tell you, as I was captured before learning any more.
