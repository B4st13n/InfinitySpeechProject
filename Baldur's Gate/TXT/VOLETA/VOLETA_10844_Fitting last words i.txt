Fitting last words if ever I have heard them. Go on then; run along. If you make it through to the Undercity alive, I will be more than surprised. No skin off my nose either way, though I'd love to see you run Sarevok through. I'll just wait here to hear about it though, if you don't mind. I ain't fool enough to run that gauntlet in there. The maze has not seen a live person pass since it was built. Maintained by her undead creators you know. Cleaned by jellies, too. Better get a move on. Off you go.
