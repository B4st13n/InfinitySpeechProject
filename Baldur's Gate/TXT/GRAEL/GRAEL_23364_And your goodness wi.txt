And your goodness will not help me, or any of my kind. All in this place are beyond the help of mortals. I am Grael, and like you I was. I fought the evil that dared to walk the earth, and this was the reward for me. I stared down the gaze of none other than a tanar'ri, and my flesh did fail. Beware you well the death gaze of the beasts of hell.
