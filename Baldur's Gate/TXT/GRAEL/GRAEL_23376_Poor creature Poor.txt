Poor creature? Poor creature?! Words of sympathy I not need! This place is an eternal tomb for the victims of battle long forgotten, and you offer pity?! Even untwisted I would laugh, but now I even hate! You who walk here just as I did: You will fall as I did from an enemy just as unthinkable! The difference is that Durlag will not be there to take the credit of victory! We fought the demon also! We fought also! Legend speaks of him, not of undead also-foughts!
