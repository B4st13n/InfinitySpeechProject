It has been decided you are to be safe here as need be. Umberlee hath no love for thee or thy cause, but hath an interest anyway. The inevitable chaos and turmoil that would follow a godly resurrection fall a touch too close to pleasing godly brethren like Talos. Anything that would amuse him is to be... discouraged. Come and go as you wish, but do not advertise the fact that you can.
