I've got in contact with one of Entar Silvershield's agents. Seems Dad is quite worried about his little girl. He's so worried that he's willing to pay good money to make sure no harm comes to her. Every two days, we're to go to the Blade and Stars and meet with someone named Elkart. Elkart will give us the ransom money, and we can be on our way.
