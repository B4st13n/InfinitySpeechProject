I am... relieved. Do not think you will go away empty-handed for your compassion. I... I will give up another item nearly as dear to me. Perhaps the two should not be separated, but you have done well by me. The Cloak of Balduran is with a favored consort of mine in the Undercellar. Quenash is her name. Go there and she will give it to you. She will know I sent you. Now please leave me.
