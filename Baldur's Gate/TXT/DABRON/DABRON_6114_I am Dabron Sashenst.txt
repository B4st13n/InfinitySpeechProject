I am Dabron Sashenstar, brother of Aldeth Sashenstar. I've been away from Baldur's Gate for many years, as I am an explorer. I am a little unnerved at how powerful this "Iron Throne" has become within our city. I assume they will try to move in on the business my brother runs, the Merchants' League.
