Aye, I doubt it not. This city holds many secrets and dangers, especially for one with a heritage such as yours... As you have rightly come to suspect, the Iron Throne lies at the core of it all somehow. Your investigations will not go unnoticed nor, like as not, unpunished. I urge you to curry the favor of Scar and Duke Eltan, both of the Flaming Fist, as they are good men at heart and capable of providing you with some guidance and protection in this urban vast. But I tarry here too long. It is best we not be seen together.
