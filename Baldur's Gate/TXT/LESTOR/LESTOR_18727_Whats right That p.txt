What's right? That place has been claiming lives hand over fist but where else can we find work? It's either death by the demons or death by the dinner plate, and us Nashkel folk aren't the type to let our families starve. I'd register with the garrison but with this bum leg, I ain't no good at fighting. Just pushin' the ore barrow, that's all.
