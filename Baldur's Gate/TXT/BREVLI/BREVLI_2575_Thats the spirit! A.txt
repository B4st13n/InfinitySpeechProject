That's the spirit! A little larceny never hurt anyone! Well, it won't hurt ME anyway. And to be fair, I would prefer if no one else suffered any injury during this exploit. I mean, I want you to steal something, but I want you to do it in as nice a way possible. It's roguery on par with Danilo Thann of Waterdeep, and I'll pay you well. 500 gold for one night's work. It's better than you could hope for in a year on the docks!
