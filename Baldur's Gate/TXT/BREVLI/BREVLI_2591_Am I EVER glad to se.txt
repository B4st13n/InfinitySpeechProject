Am I EVER glad to see your face again! It's perhaps the only honest one these walls have ever seen! I've explained my lack of coinage to the innkeep, and he replied with a suggestion involving my father and a sheep! He won't let me leave till I've paid, but his accursed interest has already turned 5 gold into 50! I don't expect a handout, but would you consider buying my ring? I paid 1,000 gold for it not a tenday ago. It's a wonderful stone. An opal. Only 500. Please?
