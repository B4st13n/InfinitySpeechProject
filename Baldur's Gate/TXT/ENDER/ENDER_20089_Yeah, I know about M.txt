Yeah, I know about Mulahey... and I spit in his face and Tazok's, too. And you know what else I know? Tazok's no Zhent man. He's got all you poor foolish bandits convinced, doesn't he? Well, mark my words, you've all gone soft if you think that's the truth of it. He covers his arse nicely and lets you and the Zhents take the rap for it.
