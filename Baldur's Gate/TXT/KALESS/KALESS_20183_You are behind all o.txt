You are behind all of this chaos? Unlikely! Most rumors I hear point to one of our own, Sarevok, to be the cause of this turmoil. Unless... unless you are the one responsible for the trouble in the Cloakwood mine! The last report we received was about the destruction you caused! You have made some powerful enemies indeed, but I have neither the time nor inclination to face you here today. It would seem some major reconstruction is in order for this branch. Major reconstruction indeed.
