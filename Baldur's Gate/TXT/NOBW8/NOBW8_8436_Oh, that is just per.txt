Oh, that is just perfect. Wonderful! All that is left is to pay you for your trouble. I fear that I am unable to give you the money I promised, however. Please forgive me, but I was desperate and you seemed so preoccupied with the gold. I figured that I must offer a large sum to get the deed done. I apologize, but I have just 500 gold to give you.
