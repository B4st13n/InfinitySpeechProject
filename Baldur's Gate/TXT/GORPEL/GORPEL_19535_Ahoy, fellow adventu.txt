Ahoy, fellow adventurers! Come share a glass with Gorpel Hind and his Band of Merry Fools. Seated with me are Farluck the Fearless, Turpin the Roaring Ranger, and Nelik the Most Devious and Fiendish of Thieves! (We owe him money so he gets the good title...) But away with these meager introductions! Sidle up to the bar and tell us a tall tale of your latest adventures!
