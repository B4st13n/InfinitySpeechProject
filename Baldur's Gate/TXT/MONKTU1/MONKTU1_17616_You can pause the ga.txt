You can pause the game at any time by hitting the SPACE BAR or left-clicking on the clock face. Unpausing occurs the same way. Pausing is most useful during combat where it gives you the time to carefully orchestrate your party's attack. While paused, issue your commands. When you unpause the game, your characters will obey the orders you have given them. If you do not use the SPACE BAR, you will find the entire game very difficult to play.
