They still have leadership. How effective it is, I do not know. I hear Angelo Dosan is now effectively in control. Such a weasel he is. I am surprised he has the support of the troops. He's got powerful friends though, and I hear that he takes orders straight from Sarevok. You've heard of him, right? With Entar dead, the other Dukes have called an emergency election. Sarevok is the frontrunner, and his stand against Amn is very popular. Imagine how much pull he will have if he actually has the Flaming Fist in his back pocket.
