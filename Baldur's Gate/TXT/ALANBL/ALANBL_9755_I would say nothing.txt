I would say nothing of the sort where another ear could hear it. If Dukes are to be killed with impunity, what chance would I stand? It is simply a curious development that Eltan would fall ill at such a time and that Angelo Dosan would step into his place with such vigor. He does not seem the ambitious sort, that Angelo, though Sarevok may have instilled a more predatory instinct in him. Sarevok has that effect, I hear, and he is supposedly working quite close with this acting head of the Flaming Fist, Angelo.
