I am unsure, however, whether the distasteful road that thou hast chosen is the result of a sadistic humor, or just the path of least resistance. If thou must indulge thy predatory instincts, at least be sure that they do not take total control. This would be especially dangerous for thee. I will impart one piece of information before I go, though 'tis hardly a surprise, I am sure. The bandits that thou dost seek make a habit of traveling in the northeast. With this, I shall take my leave.
