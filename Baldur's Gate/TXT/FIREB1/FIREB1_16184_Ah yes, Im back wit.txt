Ah yes, I'm back within the hallowed halls of Candlekeep. With this iron crisis upon us, the trip from Beregost was more hazardous than I care to relate... You're Gorion's ward, aren't you? My, you have come into your own, if you would permit an old man jealous of youth to say so... Hmm, I left an identify scroll with Tethtoril, in the inner grounds. He should be done examining it by now, so if you could fetch it for me, I'd be grateful.
