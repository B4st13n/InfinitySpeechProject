<CHARNAME>! Yes, that's the name I remember. I've seen your face in my dreams. Mmm. The dreams of you are always ones of blood and death, and there is another man who watches, an evil man. They always end with your death or mine. It is so strange that I should meet you, the focus of these dreams. You must be very special. Tell me about yourself; perhaps I can help you.
