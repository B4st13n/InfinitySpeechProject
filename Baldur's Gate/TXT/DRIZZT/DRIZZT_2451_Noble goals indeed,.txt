Noble goals indeed, and ones I would hold dear myself. Your struggle will be difficult, for the bandits that I have encountered—being beset at every turn as I am—are no mere vagabonds with blades. The humans bear the style of the Blacktalons, and the hobgoblins that of the Chill. Mercenary groups both of them, and as such it is unlikely they are the architects of this endeavor. You would do well to insinuate yourself into their ranks and determine their true masters. Difficult, but not impossible, and potentially the most fruitful course.
