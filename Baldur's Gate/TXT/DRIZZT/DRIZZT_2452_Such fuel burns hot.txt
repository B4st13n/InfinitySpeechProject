Such fuel burns hot and quick, but what of when it is spent? Attacking with hate may suffice, but it is by no means the most fruitful road to travel. These raiders of yours fight like mercenaries, and as such it is doubtful their bodies will give you more than the most cursory hint at who their masters are. Cool your fire, tread subtly, and you may find yourself closer to your true quarry. Be wary though, for the greater the potential reward, the greater the danger in acquiring it.
