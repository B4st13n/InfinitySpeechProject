Quite well off? If that was a poorly veiled attempt to inquire as to the wealth of our patrons, let me save you some time. We have a number of visitors who tend to tip rather heavily, and to protect those customers, and everyone else, we employ a large number of guards. They stand ready to assist if a patron gets a touch rowdy, as well as to deal with any scoundrels that would attempt to "sample" the possessions of their fellow revelers. You are welcome to stay, but behave yourself. You'll be glad you did.
