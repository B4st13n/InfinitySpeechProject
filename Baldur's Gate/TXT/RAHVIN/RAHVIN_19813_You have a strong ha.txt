You have a strong hatred of him, then? He doesn't seem to be that skilled at making friends. I am Rahvin, in the employ of the Iron Throne. My companions and I have traveled from Sembia to learn what has been happening to our operations in Baldur's Gate. It seems that Sarevok has been quite busy, murdering Rieltar and any other who got in his way. What he's done to you is anyone's guess. Wait! I recognize you now: you're <CHARNAME>! Ah, so you've come down here to end your crusade against the Iron Throne. Well, it'll be simple enough to dispatch you before we do Sarevok. My superiors will be quite happy to learn of your demise.
