Oh, dear! It is Samuel, and what bad shape he is in. I am glad you have brought him to me. Such a fine young man; it's a pity that he let himself be persuaded by Lena to desert the Fist. Well, nothing can be done about that, but something can be done about his health. For the service that you have provided, I want you to have some potions as a show of my gratitude.
