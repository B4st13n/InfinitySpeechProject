Yeah, I was like that once. Then I met Tazok. Now I keep my mouth shut and do what I'm told! You should too, even if it's guarding stupid ol' papers like I have to do. I dunno what Tazok sees in them, but he sure keeps them locked up tight in his tent. I better go, but just you remember what I said. Do what you're told.
