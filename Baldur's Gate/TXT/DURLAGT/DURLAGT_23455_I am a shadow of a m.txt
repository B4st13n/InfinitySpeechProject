I am a shadow of a man... I am Durlag... more or less... the spirit of the builder has long since passed... gone to whatever reward the black veil holds... this place sustains the fear... the anger... frustration... You have seen phantoms and illusions... remember what you have learned... you may yet conquer... but you must understand the paths... three paths lead away... all must be taken... seek direction...
