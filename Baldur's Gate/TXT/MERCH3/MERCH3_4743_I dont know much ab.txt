I don't know much about the bandits. They just came out of nowhere. There were hobgoblin and human mercenaries. They told us to surrender and give up our iron stores, but our captain refused them! The foolish, altruistic idiot. They fell upon us like a pack of ravenous wolves. I only barely escaped with my life. That's all I really have to tell. I had better get a move on, I have to tell the families of those who died.
