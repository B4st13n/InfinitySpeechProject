The Merchants' League sailors see markings on the ship. The shipwreck, hero, is Balduran's. These men they think that Balduran had much treasure on his final voyage. Maybe this true, but ship also has many artifacts. These things hold knowledge of Balduran's fate. I wish to recover the ship's logbook. I will solve mystery of Balduran's final voyage. Merchants' League will destroy my artifacts to get treasure. This must not happen! If you help me, I get things precious to me, you get treasure, merchant men get nothing. You will help, yes?
