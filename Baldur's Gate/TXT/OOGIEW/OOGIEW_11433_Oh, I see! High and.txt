Oh, I see! High and mighty so-and-so like you thinks you can push me around, huh? You're just as bad as that pompous old paladin downstairs! Sure, he says he's down there resting and chatting up the locals, but he's here to watch me, I know it! I can feel his beady little eyes on me even now. You get out of MY sight, 'cause I ain't going anywhere. They are ALWAYS watching me.
