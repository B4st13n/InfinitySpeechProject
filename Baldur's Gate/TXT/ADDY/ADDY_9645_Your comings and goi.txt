Your comings and goings in this city could hardly be called silent. Please, let us not start off so wrong. My name is Addy and, like you, I am no friend of the Iron Throne nor its leader, Sarevok. He's whipping the people of this city into a frenzy with his wretched war plans! And no one seems to realize that Amn, the most powerful nation—nay, empire—in the hemisphere, would crush us in an instant! I hate myself for it, but... but I am so scared for this city. Please, you must investigate the Iron Throne tower further because I know that, despite all your past efforts there, some horror still rests within its walls.
