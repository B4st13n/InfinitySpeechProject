Thank the *cluck* Mother of All Magic, mayhaps now I might end this *cluck* nightmare. I am Melicamp of Beregost, a *cluck* mage adept in the mystical arts. A... misread... incantation seems to be *cluck* the source of my troubling form. 'Tis been over a month since I *cluck* uttered a polymorph spell, and I simply cannot return to my normal *cluck* form!
