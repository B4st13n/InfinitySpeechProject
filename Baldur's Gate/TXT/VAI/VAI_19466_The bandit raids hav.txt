The bandit raids have been getting worse since you returned from Nashkel. I used to think that they were just your usual brigands out to make a quick buck in troubled times, but not anymore. They're working for someone... Damn it, this is a fine mess, isn't it? One way or another, I've got to get my troops back to the Gate! I'll pay 50 gold pieces for every bandit scalp you can bring meâ€”and spread the news. Some of the merchants in the region have also decided to pitch in and give money for the bandit scalps, but I'll give you the best price. I want this whole region cleared, and I want to know what in the Nine Hells is going on here.
