A hale and hearty hello, mine friends! A fine day, is it not? It was not always so serene in these parts though, as you can no doubt discern from the ruins about us all. Tragic loss to the area it was, some three hundred years past. I've tales though: tales of heroes and villains that have come and gone amidst these stones since that prosperous time. Could I entreat your ears to hear one? It is an epic I have been working on for some time, based on the rumors I hear and the strange things I see in my dreams at night. Would you care for a story this eve?
