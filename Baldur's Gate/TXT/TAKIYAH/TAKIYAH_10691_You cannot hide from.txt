You cannot hide from judgment while within the sight of a Shadow Druid! All who claim membership in traditional druidic orders must contend with our wrath, as will all that defile nature. I have identified Jaheira among you; no doubt she has converted you to her fantastical views wherein people live alongside nature in "harmony." Such views are weak, and must be purged! You have consorted with enemies of the Shadow Druids, and death shall be the penalty!
