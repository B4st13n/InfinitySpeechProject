Travelers are you? Takes one to know one, I guess... I don't know if you're heading that way but, if you ever end up in Baldur's Gate, keep your eyes open for Gheldehar, an old gnomish cleric. Trickier than an old wyrm, that one. He's still got an old ring of mine which I'd love to have back, actually. Oh, and in case you didn't catch it... that was a subtle hint.
