You... are correct. I did need your assistance to kill Osmadi. Thank you for the help. You were wrong about one thing. I am no "common killer." I am a Shadow Druid. I poisoned Osmadi and his companions, so that we could be rid of their weakling presence. Now we should easily be able to make this land our own. Unfortunately, there will be no room for meddling city folk. It is time for you to feel the fury of nature, as only I can administer it. Goodbye!
