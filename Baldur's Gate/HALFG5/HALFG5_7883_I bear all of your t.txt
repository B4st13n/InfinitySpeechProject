I bear all of your type a grudge. The rest of the village may think it unkind of me, but you fool dungeon rats are the reason I no longer have by brother by my side. He followed a group not unlike yours, and wound up dead in some dank hole. I suppose I canna hold you responsible for his choices, but that doesn't mean I have to enjoy your company. My apologies.
