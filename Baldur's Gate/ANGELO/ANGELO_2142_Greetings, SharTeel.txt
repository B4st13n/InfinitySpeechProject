Greetings, Shar-Teel. It seems that you have finally found friends that share tastes similar to your own. I won't answer any questions that you give me; the only reason I do this now is for what we have shared in the past, Shar. You will be blamed for the death of the guards, so I would hurry. Goodbye, Shar, I hope to never see you again.
