The iron shortage, eh? Well, there's not much to tell. With the Nashkel mines basically shut down, and bandits making it impossible to ship overland, iron's become rare. Recently though, the Iron Throne's been shipping in iron through their merchant fleet. It's really strange, 'cause their main competitors aren't doing the same. They're just lettin' the Throne hog the whole market.
