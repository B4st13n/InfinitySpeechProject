That's understandable. The creatures you have described are a very dangerous breed, IF they are the monsters I think they are. You'll still get an extra 2,000 gold, and you need not worry about retaliation from these creatures; I'll be sending in a detachment of the Flaming Fist to deal with them. Unfortunately, using this kind of strong-arm tactic on the city's premier merchant coster will bring down a lot of trouble on my head.
