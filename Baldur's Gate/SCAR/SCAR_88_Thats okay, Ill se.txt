That's okay, I'll send one of my squads to see if they can find anything out. Anyway, I have another mission for you. I'm going to need some people to do some investigating of the Iron Throne. I'm just going to finish up some paperwork, then I'll be just outside the main doors of the Flaming Fist compound. If you wish to discuss the Iron Throne, just come talk to me there.
