I done heard that the mines in Nashkel are up and running again, but we still ain't got no iron because of the bandits. I bet those snakes are just using the bandits as an excuse, staging raids themselves. I knows it's all a big plot by AMN. Never did trust them. Well, if it's war they want, they'll get it!
