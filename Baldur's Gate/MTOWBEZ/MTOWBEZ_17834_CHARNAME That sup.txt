<CHARNAME>? That supposed to mean something to me? Anyway, if you DO see them heroes, tell 'em thanks and all, but could they do something about all the bandits now? Seems like the mines and the bandits is linked somehow. Maybe Amn is behind 'em both or something. I don't know, but something should be done.
