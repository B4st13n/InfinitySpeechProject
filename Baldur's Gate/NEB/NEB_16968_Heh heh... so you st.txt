Heh heh... so you still want to get out, do you? Yes, I do hold the power in this situation, don't I...? You can love me, you can hate me, it doesn't matter... You still must do as I wish. Quick now, a riddle for my captive audience: If you look at me, we look at each other, you with eyes and me with yours. If you speak to me, I only mime your words, for while I wear your lips, I have no voice. What am I, foolish ones? What am I?
