I... I know the others would have you dead, but I'll not raise a claw in your direction. You are just as deserving of life as any other, and I would fight by your side as long as I am able. That my former friends would attack you shows that they are not who I thought they were, and I feel no shame helping you. Leave me behind if you must, but I will help as long as I can.
