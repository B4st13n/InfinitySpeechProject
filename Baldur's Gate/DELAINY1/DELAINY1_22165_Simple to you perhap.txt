Simple to you perhaps, but to we it is important of symbol. From the ship-home it came, and it is of the oldest we could salvage. It was used to drape the roof, as we use the past to move ahead. Little sense, I suppose, but symbols are important. Why should you risk yourself? Because I have asked you to. I can offer little besides my gratitude.
