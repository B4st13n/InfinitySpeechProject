Well, straight to business then. I will not waste your time with pleasantries, as I am sure I will receive none in return. If you are as fierce as you are rude, then I have need of you. I seek the return of an item, more an icon. No doubt you felt the storm that passed just by and by? Village-home did as well, and the cloak that draped the village center was cast to the wind. I think it is beyond the wall, and will not risk the beasts to get it. Will you?
