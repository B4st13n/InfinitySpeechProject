Good day, travelers. Mmm, Edwin, I did not expect to see you so soon. I hope your... business has been attended to, Edwin, for if it hasn't, then you should do so soon. I think that Zulkir Nevron would be most disappointed if he were to hear that you failed. That is all that really needs to be said. Good day again, and goodbye.
