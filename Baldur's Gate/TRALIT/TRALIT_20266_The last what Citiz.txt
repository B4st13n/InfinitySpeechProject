The last what? Citizen? Flaming Fist soldier? He has them all in his pocket and they believe in him. He is to be a Grand Duke, stepping in to replace Entar Silvershield, and he has the full support of the people. He has promised to restore order, and since he created the chaos I am sure he will be fairly successful. I would not be surprised if he was behind Entar's death. Likely the other Dukes are in similar peril. Sarevok seems bent on causing destruction, and the smallest diversion is crushed viciously. I must go. I trust I am beneath your concern, so you will not kill me? I hope so.
