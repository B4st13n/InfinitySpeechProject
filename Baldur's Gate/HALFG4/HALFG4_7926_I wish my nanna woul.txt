I wish my nanna would let me go out with you. I wish, I wish... Aw, she'll never let me go. Before you go, how 'bout I give you somethin' to help you out. I know it's really valuable, 'cause Nanna keeps it all locked up. I kinda borrowed it for a while, but now I want you to have it. Here ya go. Come back soon and tell me 'bout all your adventures.
