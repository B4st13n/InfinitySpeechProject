I am sure that was meant as an insult, but I will not take it as such. Halflings are among the most generous of races I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. Being compared to one of their number is a great compliment, though I confess I lack their accompanying tact and manners. For instance, they would never dream of having guards drag you from one of their burrows, and yet I was considering that very thing. It's embarrassing that I lack their self control. Perhaps you should leave before I am put in the position of acting this through.
