I am a proud member of the Flaming Fist. Our headquarters is in Baldur's Gate, though we also operate in Beregost and the Friendly Arm Inn. We are quite concerned about the sudden rarity of iron. Many think that the nation of Amn is gearing up for war against our great city. If this were the case, I don't know how well we would do, lacking a resource as important as iron.
