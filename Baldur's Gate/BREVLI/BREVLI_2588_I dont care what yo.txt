I don't care what you do with it, though I wouldn't try to sell it if I were you! Every merchant from here to Cormyr will know it's stolen goods, and most of the fences 'round here probably won't want to touch it either. Maybe if you dump it back on the step of the Hall of Wonders it will cool the ire of the guard. Either way, bury it before it buries you! Oh, I am NOT cut out for this lifestyle.
