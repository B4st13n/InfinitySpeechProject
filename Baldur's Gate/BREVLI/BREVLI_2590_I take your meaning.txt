I take your meaning well and clear. I shall just have to procure the needed skills elsewhere. It should not be so difficult, perhaps that nice gentleman I bumped into on the way in. Polite as a saint, he was. Must dash... Oh, dear. Um, it would appear that I have misplaced my purse. The strings appear to have snapped. How odd. No matter, I shall simply explain my situation to the innkeep and have him extend some friendly credit. I'm certain it will be no trouble. Everyone has been so accommodating thus far.
