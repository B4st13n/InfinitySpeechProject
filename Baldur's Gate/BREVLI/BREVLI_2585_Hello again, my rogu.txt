Hello again, my roguish compatriot! I heard this morning that there was a mysterious break-in at the Hall of Wonders. It's said that the crafty burglars were in like ghosts and gone before the guard even had a chance to yell halt. Ooh, it's like an adventure tale starring you and me! You are well worth your pay, my friend, well worth it! Here is your 500 gold and a beautiful little trinket from my own personal collection. It's a sorrow to part with it, but this more than makes up. Goodbye and good fortune be on you.
