I... I am sorry for my rudeness. It would seem that I was quite disturbed even before you came anywhere near me. I simply get tired of the asking, especially when people find the answers too vague. The stars are not a reference book with everything laid out plain. Were it so, anyone could pick the page they wished and there would be no need for one such as me. As it is, I have little to say of our current troubles.
