We all will, friend. Hear that boys? The child is dead! We'll be back to our boats tomorrow with smooth sailing forever! The Bitch Queen can't touch us now, and we'll take her seas for all they're worth! And to you, my heroic saviors, to you go the spoils. Behold the mystical marvel that is my grandfather's flail. Enjoy.
