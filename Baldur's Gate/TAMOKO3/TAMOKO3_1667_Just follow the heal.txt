Just follow the healer when he leaves the Flaming Fist stronghold. He leaves at midnight every night. If you follow him, you'll learn his true identity. Remember, don't kill him immediately, otherwise they'll just send another one in the exact form. If you can kill him in full view of Eltan, then the duke will be alerted to the real identity of his healer.
