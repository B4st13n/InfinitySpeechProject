You must promise me that you will defeat Sarevok, the man behind all of your woes. You must destroy his plans, stop his mad scheme in its tracks. You must strip him of dignity and pride, but you must not kill him. You must promise me that. Without my help you'll never defeat him, he is a better man than you. Promise me you'll spare his life in defeat, and I will give you what you need to defeat him.
