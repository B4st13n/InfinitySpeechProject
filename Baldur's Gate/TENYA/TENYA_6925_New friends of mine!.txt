New friends of mine! You may call me Tenya, and know that I am a priestess of Umberlee. For many weeks now I have searched for the relic that was stolen from my mother. The fishermen Telman, Jebadoh, and Sonner stole it when they became jealous of her power. I will soon have my revenge against these petty fishermen.
