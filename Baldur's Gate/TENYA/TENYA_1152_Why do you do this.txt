Why do you do this? Don't you know what they've done? Sonner and the others, THEY are the EVIL ones! They killed my mother, and now you help them?! She only did her duty, collecting the offerings from those that would use the sea. They stole her elemental summoning bowl and tortured her for the words that make it work. Now they all misuse a gift from Umberlee to pillage the seas, and my mother's spirit can't rest until it is returned. I have more power than mother had. Umberlee gave me her anger, but I can't find the bowl. All I can do is hurt them till they give it back or die, but I'm so tired. I don't have mother's will, and the goddess is so demanding. Help me, please.
