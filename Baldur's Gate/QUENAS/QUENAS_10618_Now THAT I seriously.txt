Now THAT I seriously doubt! Still, I did not think he would give up the cloak either. It does not matter much; I have no idea where the helm would be. He... he did mention something about hiding it. What was it he said? He said that he could not have found a better location to hide both the cloak and the helm, and that the building was practically named for the purpose, but that he would let me keep the cloak because he did not want both items in such a public place. Does this help you?
