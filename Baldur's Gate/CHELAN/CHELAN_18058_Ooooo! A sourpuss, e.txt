Ooooo! A sourpuss, eh? Well, best you be moving on then, because I won't be letting your foul mood darken my day. Sure there's trouble in the mines, bandits roaming the woods, and all manner of beastie munching on innocent travelers, but if you dwell on every little detail it's eventually going to drive you nuts. NUTS! I for one am not going to let that happen to me. No, <SIRMAAM>, not going to happen.
