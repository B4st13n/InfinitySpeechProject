You are entitled to your interpretation, though I prefer to think of myself as optimistic. I've been put out of work because of the iron shortage too, blah blah blah and all that rot. I have simply chosen to not let it get me down. So I'm out of the mine, so what? I'll fish for food, and look decidedly less pale at the end of the day because I got some sun for a change. Now if you don't mind, I've some SINGING to do!
