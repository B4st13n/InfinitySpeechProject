Yeah, I think you'll do fine. I need someone to go club some heads for me. I was ambushed by a band o' hobgoblins within sight of this inn's walls. Robbed me blind, they did, and I want to return the favor. I don't care about most of my things, but I want to get my ring back. My father gave it to me, you understand?
