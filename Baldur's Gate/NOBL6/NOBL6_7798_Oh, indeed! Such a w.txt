Oh, indeed! Such a wondrous depository it is. I have returned on many an occasion, much to my banker's dismay, and have not even scratched the surface of the collection here.

I suppose it makes them appear more intelligent, though simple quizzing places the majority of them securely about the chimp "level." I am sorry, I tend to ramble. Good eve to you.
