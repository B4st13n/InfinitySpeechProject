Well, have a look at my wares. These here are high quality forgeries of the official invitation. Use at your own risk, though, 'cause the guards might take a second look at the likes of you. I'm taking extra risks giving this out to your type, you realize, so it's gonna cost a little more than usual. Does 250 gold pieces sound good?
