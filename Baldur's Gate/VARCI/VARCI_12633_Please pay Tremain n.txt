Please pay Tremain no mind, we have risked much only to have failed. Though our deal was not completed, and you not paid, we respect that you tried nonetheless. I shall spread the word among the clergy that you are to be extended every hospitality. As much as Tremain has tried to keep this private, a number of his brethren know and sympathize with his plight. They will look kindly on you if needs be. Goodbye.
