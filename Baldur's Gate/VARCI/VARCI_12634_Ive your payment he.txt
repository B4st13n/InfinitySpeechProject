I've your payment here. Tsk, it will be some time before Casson and I get a night out again. It is good to have him back among the living, though I take some small pleasure in the trouble he's in for what we did. You'll notice I've not sat down since you've known me. Sometimes "Our Lady Who Smiles" downright laughs out loud. Look to us if you need aid in the future. Many a Tymoran will look favorably on you now. Good day.
