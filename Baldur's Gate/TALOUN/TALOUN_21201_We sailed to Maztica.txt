We sailed to Maztica and returned, laden with spices. The ship was attacked by a kraken and dragged beneath the waves. Those of us that survived were pulled, one by one, into the kraken's beak to be eaten. I clung to some of the ships planking and somehow the kraken missed me. I drifted for days, eating me shoes and drinking only rainwater.
