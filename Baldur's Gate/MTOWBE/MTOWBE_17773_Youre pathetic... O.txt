You're pathetic... Okay, I'll rattle it off for you like I did for the last adventurer and the one before that. I have no doubt you'll share their fate. Let's see, there are the ruins of an old mage school to the southeast. Traps, dead things that try to kill you, you know the schtick... Then there's the Firewine Bridge: ghosts, winding narrow passageways, some poetry, blah, blah, blah... Honestly, I can't think of a life more tedious than that of an adventurer. Personally, I get far more out of wandering around aimlessly and scratching my arse like this.
