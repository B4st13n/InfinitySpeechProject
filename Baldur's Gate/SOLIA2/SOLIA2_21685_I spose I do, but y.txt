I s'pose I do, but you can't tell anyone I told you. They would be mad at me for sure. I get out through the fence along the east beach. Mommay never found out, even though I bring flowers back for her. You go that way and you will be okay, okay? Please try not to hurt too many. Most of the village is happy here by themselves. Don't want to hurt anybody. They don't trust you though. I gotta go, bye bye.
