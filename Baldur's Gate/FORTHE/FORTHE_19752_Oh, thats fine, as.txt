Oh, that's fine, as I have more than enough money to spend. Basically I require a few stories from you, which I will alter slightly for dramatic effect and present as my own. I could just make something up, but such efforts never ring true. They must be believable if the masses are going to fall for them. So what do you say? Shall I pay you... oh... how about 200 gold a story?
