Has Xzar not told you? Perhaps I have spoken too soon. We are the Zhentarim and I am Xzar's superior. He has been making regular reports to me about your party and the progress of your investigations into the iron crisis. Your work has been exemplary and of great service to our cause. Now go, purge this city of the Iron Throne's presence. They have become more than a nuisance to us... They have become a threat.
