Life has been pretty lousy lately; how about you, friend? My bitch of a wife slept with some elvish mongrel, and even had his child. By the Nine Hells, does she ever have gall. Anyway, she's not laughing anymore; I cursed the child of that unholy union, so that it would die an early death. I hope the little brat drowns in its own vomit.
