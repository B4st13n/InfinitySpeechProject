What is a thief to do, huh? You invest in some Boots of Stealth, you set up shop in the badlands to the south of Beregost and then, WHAM... Along comes a tribe of hobgoblins and they tear the boots from right off your feet! Damn blasted bullies is what they are and I'll pay 100 gold to whoever can get them back to me, I will... Oh, look! It's Drizzt Do'Urden!
