Then call me Jessa... To be perfectly honest, <CHARNAME>, my contingent and I are cut off from Baldur's Gateâ€”we haven't received new orders for close to a week. If you have issues with my superiors, then so be it, but don't drag them in here because, as things stand now, I couldn't care less. My contingent and I are on our own now and, quite frankly, all we want to do is make it home.
