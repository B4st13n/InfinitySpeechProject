I am Taurgosz Khosann, and I have killed ten men with a single stroke of my hammer. Though many of my men think we work for Zhentarim, that is just told to them in case they are captured. In reality we are paid through Tazok by the Iron Throne. They want us to disrupt all iron shipments coming into the region.
