Well, I think you should know that there's been a lot of people asking about you. There were a man and woman who were asking about someone named <CHARNAME>, and then there was this spooky fellow who was doing the same. A few days ago there was a big man who was looking for someone with your name. I don't know why ye're so popular, but I'd watch it: Some of these people didn't look too sociable.
