Word around here is that the west road is the safest, at least for now. The road south to Beregost is dangerous but there's still been some traffic. Farther south to Nashkel is supposed to be some rough traveling. No more caravans are making it through from the iron mine down there but it's probably just as well. Their iron's been weak as tin of late. As for the road north, well... we haven't had a shipment from Baldur's Gate for more than a month. For all we know, it's been sacked and burnt.
