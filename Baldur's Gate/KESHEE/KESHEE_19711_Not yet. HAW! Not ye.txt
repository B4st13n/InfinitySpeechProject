Not yet. HAW! Not yet, I says! You asked if I had lived here all my life, and I says not yet! I can still make 'em laugh, by gum. That joke used to have the boys on deck rolling around like flounders flopping on the poop deck. Of course they stopped laughing so much a few years back after they had heard it for the thousandth time. Come to think of it, you're not laughing all that much either. Ehh, I'll just go stand over here a while.
