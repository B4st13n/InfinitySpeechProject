As is often the case with great men, no one knows what became of him. He set out one day for the fabled isles of Anchorome and was not seen again. Some occasionally say that they see the rigging of his ship on the horizon, and the more romantic tales speak of him sailing the stars themselves. Many a cynic claims that he simply foundered on some deserted isle, but talk like that around here and you'll likely be fed your teeth. I've talked your ear off, I have. I'll let you be on your way.
