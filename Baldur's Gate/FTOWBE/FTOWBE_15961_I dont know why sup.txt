I don't know why supplies of iron ore are dwindling. Can't a simple increase in trade solve the crisis? Baldur's Gate is a major route between Waterdeep and Amn. I suppose the bandits have the whole area almost completely cut off and it would cost a lot to send troops out this way. Don't they realize how serious this is?
