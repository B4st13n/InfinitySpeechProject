Competition of the Iron Throne. Mostly members of the Seven Suns trading coster or the Merchants' League. They have both been attempting to negotiate a tentative peace between the different economic powers in the city. I fear it's not peace they're finding, however... at least not of the type they came looking for. Something's going on upstairs and I'd rather not think about what it could be.
