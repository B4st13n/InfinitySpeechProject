What knowledge would you like from me? I could tell you about the beautiful forests of Tethyr, or the many gorgeous damsels that have fallen for my charms. I have studied up on the wyverns that prey upon the area. They have wicked barbs upon their tales, which they use to poison their victims. They are cruel beasts that enjoy inflicting suffering upon their prey. I really have not much more to say.
