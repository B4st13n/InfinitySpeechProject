Strange? Why yes, that is just the word I would have used for that Koveras fellow. He was right here beside me, taking Alaundo's prophecies from their place on the shelf and reading them. I could hear his voice, recognize the Seer's words upon his quiet voice, but when I turned to steal a glance at him from the corner of my eye, it was the strangest thingâ€”his eyes were closed and he was reciting it, page after page, by memory! He heard your footsteps, it seems, and wandered off... I was just returning the prophecies to their rightful place here. It might be wise to take a look. Wait here then while I talk with the Watchers.
