I lead the druids of Cloakwood. As master of these woods, I know much of what happens within its bounds. One thing that might interest you is the presence of an armed encampment in the northeast of the forest. An organization known as the Iron Throne makes residence in the fort. Though I do not know their purpose for being there, it should be known that their fort is built above an abandoned dwarven iron mine.
