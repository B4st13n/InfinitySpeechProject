Wizards, Clerics, Druids, and Bards can all cast spells. Select their Cast Spell button, choose a spell, and tap on your target. You can also configure Quick Spells by tapping and holding on a Quick Spell slot. This summons a list of memorized spells to choose. If no spells are listed, the character either does not have any spells memorized or cannot cast until higher levels. To cast the quick spell, tap on the appropriate quick spell slot and then select your target.
