Not much at all, but rumors are never in short supply. I hear that these meetings are more like negotiations, because the Iron Throne threatens to move into Knights of the Shield territory. I overheard one of them, accidentally of course, and I think the Iron Throne has gained a lot of power from the iron shortage. Appropriate, don't you think? They are meeting here because they consider it neutral ground and relatively safe. I doubt Keeper of the Tomes Ulraunt would have allowed their entry, had he known who they are, though they have done nothing wrong here.
