Well, hello there. Not too sure what you expected to find in here, but perhaps you have come to the wrong house by mistake. I am Galteran, and I was just doing a bit of cleaning in the spare time I find myself with. Not much call for my grunt-type labor right now, what with caravans staying away. *sigh* Ah, well. Best be on your way, please.
