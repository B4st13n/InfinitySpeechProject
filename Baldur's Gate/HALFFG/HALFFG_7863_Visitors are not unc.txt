Visitors are not uncommon. Only those that are... unique enough to have cast off hearth and home to follow the wandering life. Not many a small folk can understand why anyone would leave their homes and not seek new ones. I fancy they shall not know whether to call you daft or just... eh... eccentric. Either way, most will still welcome you to their homes.
