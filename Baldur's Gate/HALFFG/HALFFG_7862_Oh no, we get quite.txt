Oh no, we get quite the traffic as far as merchants and caravans go. It's just the wandering adventurer that raises the eyebrows. No doubt you shall feel like quite the spectacle during your stay, but it's only because the small folk admire the spirit of Littleman that you possess. He was our greatest wanderer in all of halfling history. You are an oddity, but also to be admired. Welcome to you, and enjoy your stay.
