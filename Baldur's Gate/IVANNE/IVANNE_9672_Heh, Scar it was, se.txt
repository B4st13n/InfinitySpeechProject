Heh, Scar it was, second-in-command of that noble Flaming Fist, and on a night-dark street it happened. The rain, 'twas spattering against the window's glassy panes and soaking up through me bootwraps, givin' me the chill. A cunning cut-throat rushed on by 'im an' cut the straps o' his travel purse wit' a blood-sharp knife before turnin' down the alleyway. Aye, good man Scar, he chased the culprit there into the dark as I came stumblin' through the puddles to 'is aid.
