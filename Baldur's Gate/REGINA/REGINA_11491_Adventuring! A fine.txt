Adventuring! A fine and glorious pastime that passes time like no other! To seek the highs and lows of the depths and heights; to follow in the footsteps leading down paths never trod upon; to plumb the furthest reaches of oneself while exploring the very world just outside your door. Such a life is a grand one indeed, though simple in its complexity!
