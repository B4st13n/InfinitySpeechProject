The whole city is on edge, so I would be careful everywhere. Things are really strange by the Iron Throne building though. I heard their leaders were killed or something. Sarevok has announced that he is assuming control of them though, and he's going to use their resources to help reinforce the city against Amn. He's making a lot of friends, and I bet he will be nominated to replace poor Entar as Grand Duke.
