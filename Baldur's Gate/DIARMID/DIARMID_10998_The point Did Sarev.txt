The point? Did Sarevok not tell you? I suppose he might not have; he does have a tendency to only give information on a need-to-know basis. It hardly matters now, though. The monks of the keep are firmly of the belief that <CHARNAME> murdered the Iron Throne leaders with no provocation. <CHARNAME> has been locked away, and by the time they are sent to Baldur's Gate for trial Sarevok will have full control of the city. <CHARNAME>'s fate will be his to decide. You and your band were not needed to guard the boss's escape route after all. Everything went as planned. Shall we go now?
