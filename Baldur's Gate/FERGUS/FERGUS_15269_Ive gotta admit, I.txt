I've gotta admit, I ain't never been happier. Got a letter from my lady and she's gonna be home reeeal soon... Just gotta find me a pretty little ring for her pretty little finger and all's gonna be just fine, just fine. But my lady, she transcends gold or silver or fancy stones. She'll have nothing less than an angel skin ring from me.
