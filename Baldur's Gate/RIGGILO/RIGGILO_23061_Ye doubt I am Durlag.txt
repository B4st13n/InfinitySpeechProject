Ye doubt I am Durlag? Well, give the fool a prize; turns out I'm not the dwarf that's been dead o'er a bunch of centuries. Good for you, but my question still stands: Who are you? I don't care a whit what you are doing in the tower; I just want to know what you are doing sneaking up on my backside. I don't like people sneakin' near me. Makes me nervous.
