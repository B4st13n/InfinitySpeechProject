I care not whether the primitives who lived here worshipped chickens and the plate produces fodder! It does not matter! What DOES matter, is that we potentially have an item associated with a god long since lost to the mists of time. Its former enchantments may not even work, but it will still command an exorbitant price from a historian or collector. Do you wish a piece of the pie or don't ya?
