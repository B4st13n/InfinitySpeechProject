Aye, we could have a crop, for starters. See those crusted mounds of earth? They're all left over from last year's harvest. The sun's baked them firm and hard and the plow breaks at the very thought of trying to turn that tortured soil. My son tried pushing the new seeds in between the cracks but I doubt anything will come of it. Come this time next year, we'll all be living in the endless slums of Athkatla. So yes, I wish things were better in this here pristine and pastoral setting!
