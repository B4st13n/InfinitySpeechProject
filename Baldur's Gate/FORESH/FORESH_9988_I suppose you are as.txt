I suppose you are asking of the immediate south, such as Nashkel and its mines? Unfortunately, no, I have spent no time there. I have busied myself with destinations more distant and have traveled to the great city of Athkatla on one occasion or another. You should really consider visiting there sometime. 'Tis likely to be very popular in the future. None of this helps you now, of course. Cheerio.
