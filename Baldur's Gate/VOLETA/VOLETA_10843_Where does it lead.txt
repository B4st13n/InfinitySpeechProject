Where does it lead? You want to follow him? You'll be dead before you get a hundred feet, but I guess it's your life. The maze apparently connects to the Undercity, but I ain't heard of nobody that has gone through and lived to tell. It's kinda meant as a decoy retreat of sorts. Lead intruders down here and they think it's the way out. Usually you don't see them again after that. Ain't seen a live person leave ever. She's full o' undead and kept clean by jellies. Better get a move on if you hope to catch them. I'm just going to stay here and catch my breath.
