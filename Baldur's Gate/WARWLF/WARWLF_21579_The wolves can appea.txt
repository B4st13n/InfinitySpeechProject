The wolves can appear to be human, but don't be fooled, they are animals at heart. They will kill for pleasure as much as for food. The younger wolf beasts are much weaker than their elders. They are dark brown in color with some black fur. They are completely tactless. They will attack without thought regardless of the odds.
