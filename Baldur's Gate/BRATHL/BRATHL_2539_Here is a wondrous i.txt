Here is a wondrous item forged from the mind of one of our respected gnomish brethren. Known as a Steam Dragon, it is a remarkable if somewhat noisy means of moving large objects. The fire in its belly powers mighty gears that can be affixed to belts and pulleys, hauling loads that would require dozens of strong backs. Our own harbor employs such items on a grand scale, relieving ships of their cargo in a matter of moments. A mite detrimental to the jobs of several longshoremen when installed, it has greatly improved the health of the few remaining.
