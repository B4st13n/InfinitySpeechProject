Another marvel of ingenuity, the Pump of Gond. By standing astride the seat one is able to move water as a mill wheel might, with only the power of the legs. Excellent for watering fields or draining a flooded home. Hard work to ride for long, it does spare the back and neck from bearing the weight of buckets.
