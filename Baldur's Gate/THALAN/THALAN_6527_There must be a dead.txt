There must be a dead element, yes. That is what the skull is for. I cannot fully explain what I am to try, but it's something of a reversal on the reincarnation scheme. The age of the enchantment that changed you may allow for a loophole in the laws of magic. Of course it may just kill us both in the casting. Such is life. Off you go to some dungeon or another. Return with the skull. Go.
