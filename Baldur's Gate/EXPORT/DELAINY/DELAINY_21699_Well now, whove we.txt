Well now, who've we here? You're a fine-looking fellow if ever I've seen one. The elders have mentioned the outside from time to time, but never did they say such stock ran hearty in those far away climes. Have you come to stay, or are you just here to break some hearts and begone? I'm undecided as to which I would prefer. You have an... alluring scent that I am quite unused to.
