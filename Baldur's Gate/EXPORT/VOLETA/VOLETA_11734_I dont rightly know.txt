I don't rightly know, though it is said there is a city beneath this one. Some archaeologist smart-arsed sage might be able to tell you more about it. It's not a proper city down there, you understand. Just the remains. Not surprising, really. If the site that Baldur's Gate is built on is so appealing, it would figure that there would have been one built here before. I care little: nothing but dead down there now. Get moving.
