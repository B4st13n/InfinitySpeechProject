The job has already been done! Who needs YOU when we have Sarevok?! If not for that fool they have accused, I would have guessed Sarevok killed our leaders. He has frittered away our gold, used our grandest plots to inflame governments, and done nothing but laugh when accused of ruining our organization! He seems quite sane, so I can only assume he has some motive of his own. It is not to the benefit of the Iron Throne, that much is certain. Do what you will. I am leaving before anything else goes wrong.
