Well, good sirs, you may call me Safana. You'll have to excuse me if I sound startled, but in the south where I come from they don't grow their men as big as any of you. Anyhow, if you want, I have a way to make you all fabulously wealthy. In my possession I have a map that gives the location of an old pirate treasure trove. According to the writings on the map, it's where the legendary Black Alaric dumped his treasure before being captured by the Amnian fleets! You interested in hearing more?
