Here be an amazement if ever there was one. Without question you have all seen a mariner's standard spyglass? That crude device that roughs out a coastline? It is but a shadow of this work of art from faraway Lantan. We are informed that it was labeled a "tell-a-scope" or some such when initially assembled, but we have taken to calling it a Farseer. A much more elegant name for its function and craftsmanship. The faces of the stars themselves are visible with its aid, and one is liable to run out of earth before running out of sight. Our local craftsmen have not been able to recapture Gond's original inspiration, and the inner workings remain a detailed mystery. Thus, while copies of its beauty are available, they function no better than the spyglass I mentioned.
