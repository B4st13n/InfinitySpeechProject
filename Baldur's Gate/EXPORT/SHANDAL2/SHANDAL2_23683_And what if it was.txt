And what if it was? It is not of my making. I myself was once a resident for a time. It tends to snag passing teleporting mages from time to time. I left my magics and gadgets and was able to use some minor incantations to escape. Passive resistance is more successful when the very ground seems to drag magic to it. The others might find their release if they lose the anger and attachment to their toys. Ah, I will not argue this with you, the place was not of my making. You have done well enough. Goodbye.
