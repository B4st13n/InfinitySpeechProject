I have already challenged, and you have answered as a spoiled child. It is as I expected, but before you get your candy today you must do something for me. I propose a task that you must complete. If you are of worth, perhaps you will survive and I shall not kill you outright. Perhaps you won't survive and I will not have to worry about it. Perhaps I will forget you there, so do be polite.
