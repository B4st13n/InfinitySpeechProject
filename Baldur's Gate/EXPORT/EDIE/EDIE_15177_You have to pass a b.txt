You have to pass a big test to get into the Merchants' League around here so I've been studying and studying but it just doesn't seem to sink in. Being merchants, I don't think they're too concerned about honesty and integrity, though. If you've got a spell or potion that would bump up my intelligence or wisdom for the next little bit, I'd greatly appreciate it.
