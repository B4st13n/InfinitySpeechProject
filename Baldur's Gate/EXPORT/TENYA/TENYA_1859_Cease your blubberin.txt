Cease your blubbering. It is an insult to show such pathos in the sight of Umberlee! Perhaps we should make ye prove your mettle, that we might forget this sickening display? The body you seek shall be at the front gate. Get there and it is yours to do with as you see fit. Of course my fellow waveservants will do their utmost to hinder your progress. It is sure to be an amusing diversion for the Sea Queen.
