Well, I imagine you're either the cause or a victim of the carnage I heard to the north last night, then. It's a shame what the iron shortage has done to people's manners. You would do well to treat people you meet with a touch more respect, at least until you determine if they're a threat or not. You'll not get far if you don't make friends, though there are a couple of fellows on the road to the east that would suit your demeanor quite nicely, I am sure.
