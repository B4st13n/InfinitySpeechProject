The mine? Um, I... I think they were going to try to look like the saviors of the day, riding in with their stores of iron to equip the troops or something like that. With the bandit raids and the rumors about Amn, the Iron Throne figured that the dukes of Baldur's Gate would think they needed arms and ore quickly in case of Amnian attack. They... they figured they could get exorbitant prices or better yet, sanctions against competitors and an easing of trade laws for themselves only. A quick way to install themselves as an underground power on the coast. That's all I know about it, I swear!
