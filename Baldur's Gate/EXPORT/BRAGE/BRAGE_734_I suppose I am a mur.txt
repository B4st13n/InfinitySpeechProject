I suppose I am a murderer, as you hast said, though it's as though my mind were elsewhere. I can only assume this is an after-effect of my years wielding a blade. A life of fighting must have made me... unstable. Well, I'm done with it! Take all my gear and do with it what you will. I'll not be needing it in the gallows. Lead on.
