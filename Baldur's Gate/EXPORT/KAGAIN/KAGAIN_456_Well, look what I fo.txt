Well, look what I found. This is the body of Silvershield's son. Guess I'm in a lot of trouble now. With him dead, I'll be a wanted dwarf. From what I've gathered so far, all of you are after them damnable bandits. Well, since my reputation is now mud how 'bout I help you gain revenge on those scumbags?
