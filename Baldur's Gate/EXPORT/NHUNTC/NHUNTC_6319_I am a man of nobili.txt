I am a man of nobility, so you can be sure of the accuracy of what I now tell you. There are several wildmen that inhabit these woods. "Druids" they call themselves, but this is just a name to disguise their bloodthirsty nature. They are killers and must be hunted down, as they have already taken the life of a very dear friend of mine!
