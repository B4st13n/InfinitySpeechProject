You'll get no coin from me over this matter. I will pay the way of no adventurer. Everyone makes their own bed to lay in, and must reap the rewards of their own actions. Now, if this little chicken-afflicted fellow wishes to pay you he may, though I wager he has little more than the items he stole from me.
