You know nothing of me! Best that you pray, to whatever deity turns your crank, that you NEVER face what I have seen. Bah! The inexperience and STUPIDITY of youth. I care not if you go out and get yourself killed, for it's not the least favorable end you could face! If you have business here I suggest you get to it! Otherwise, begone!
