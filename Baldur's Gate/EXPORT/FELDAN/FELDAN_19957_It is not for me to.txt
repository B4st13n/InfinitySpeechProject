It is not for me to say, but I should keep an eye on your purse strings while here. Three are from the Iron Throne, supposedly the leaders themselves. The others are from Amn. I believe they are representing the Knights of the Shield. They both claim this trip is to discuss future trading relations, because the Iron Throne has grown so much of late. I know very little of the economics of Baldur's Gate, but I would hazard a guess that both are more than mere businessmen.
