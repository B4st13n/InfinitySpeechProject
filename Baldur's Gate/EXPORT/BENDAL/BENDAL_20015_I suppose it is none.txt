I suppose it is none of my business. I merely wished to welcome you back. I see you are as tactless as ever. Such a pity that so many are so rude these days. That Koveras fellow is like that as well. Shistal has even become rude. Perhaps I am just too sensitive. Off with you. I wish to continue my studies.
