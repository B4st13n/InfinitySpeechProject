Nice apology. Before we leave I'd better warn you: There are bandits that have been causing trouble along the Coast Way, you'd be best to avoid them. Also, I've been searching for a deserter by the name of Samuel. He's traveling with a woman, so if you see him, remember, there's a 50 gold reward for his capture.
