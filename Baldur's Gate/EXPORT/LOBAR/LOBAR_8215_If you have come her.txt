If you have come here simply to insult my patrons and I, I shall have to ask you to leave. If you are rich, however, we can provide a steady stream of "lowlifes" for you to belittle. It's rather a commonly sought service for some of our more "well to do" clientele, and apparently good for bolstering a poor self-image. Not that your actions suggest you have a poor self-image. No, that's not what I was implying at all. Good day.
