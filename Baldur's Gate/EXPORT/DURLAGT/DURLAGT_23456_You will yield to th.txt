You will yield to this place... if you do not understand... you have seen phantoms and illusions... shadows of those long since passed beyond the black veil of death to whatever reward... This place... harbors the anger... the fear... you will have to understand what built it... to pass by unharmed... seek direction... understand the paths... three paths lead away... all must be taken...
