Me granda' was slain by an evil demon but Durlag survived. Durlag kept "Soultaker" that had been me granda's. He was going to send it to me mother, but he was betrayed. A sad tale, that. After Durlag built the tower his family was replaced by doppelgangers. Durlag killed them all but was driven mad by the act. He entrapped his tower heavily and forgot about me granda's dagger.
