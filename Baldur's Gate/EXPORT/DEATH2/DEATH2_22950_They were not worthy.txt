They were not worthy of my blade. With the aid of a trinket they destroyed themselves. They should thank, that I allowed them to die by their own hand instead of killing them like insects. One yet lives. Perhaps I should kill with the old rituals, and bring forth a proper minion. He will outlive his worthless companions in undeath. Their age is your age is the age of all mortals, and it is irrelevant. You do not know true age, and you could not until you have outlived a dragon or an elf, or a legend. Death can be eternal sleep, or the one eternal life. You will know the sleep, and I will still be the life. You have fulfilled your purpose. I took the tower as a base that is fortified and secure. You have been the foolish maid service that cleaned it of traps for me. The madness of Durlag has built me a fine home, and you have swept the floors.
