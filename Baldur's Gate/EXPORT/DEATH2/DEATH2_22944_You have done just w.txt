You have done just what I wished. I need a base that is fortified and secure, and I also do not wish my hirelings to die with every step. I bait some foolish adventurers in and they make the floors safe. They come this far and die, and I do not need to sully my hands removing traps. I need not dirty hands at all. Foolish flesh kills itself with my Mirror of Opposition. Durlag has built me a fine home, and you have been excellent maid service. It is the duty of the flesh to toil and then be laid to rest. Perhaps you will forsake the flesh and return, but I doubt you to be that privileged.
