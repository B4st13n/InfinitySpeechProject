I'm sure you will, but you'll not find it here. Sarevok was the architect of that plot, and we are all victims of it. If you seek him, I would look towards the Ducal Palace. There is to be a coronation there soon, and it will likely give Sarevok power enough to do what he wishes in this city. I imagine the fates of the remaining present Dukes will be much the same as that of Entar as well. I hope you have proof enough to convince people of his evil. Your confrontation will be very short otherwise.
