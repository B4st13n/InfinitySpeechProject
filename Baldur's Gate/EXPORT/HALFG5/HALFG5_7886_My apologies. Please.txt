My apologies. Please, don't let my course manner send you away when every other home in Gullykin welcomed you. I am sour towards the wandering folk, but it is nothing personal. I lost a brother to a dungeon, but that is no more your fault than mine. Stay as you will, and forgive me my coarse behavior.
