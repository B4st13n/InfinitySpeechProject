I have heard the tales of fell servants that walk the Prime. Am I afraid because I believe? No, I know what is here. Have you had the pleasure of seeing? A demon in knight's clothing, a demon knight that serves the underworld. I care not whether you have killed all the kobolds in Calimshan, attacking this beast directly is suicide. It is truly beyond thought. What it is even doing here, I do not know. Durlag was certainly not in league with such a beast, but it has made a home here nonetheless.
