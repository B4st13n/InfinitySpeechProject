No one is what they are at first glance. Not even you, no matter how you try. I see you with some merit, but you are rude on top and hard to know. If we offer nothing to each other, then go. Leave this place and people. We will not share our "surprises" with you. You are more animal than civilized in your manner, and that is funny for reasons you know not yet. Leave me and we. Our pack is strong without you.
