Xzar did not have time to tell you, then... The Iron Throne has many enemies. I am one of them. Xzar was another. He had been making regular reports to me about your party and the progress of your investigations into the present crisis. When the last few reports didn't come, I assumed that the messengers had been forced to take a more lengthy route due to the bandit activity. But this, this is far worse. Alone, Montaron is of little use to us and you... I do not know if you can be trusted... Please, leave us be. It is time for us to revise our thinking on this entire matter.
