You needn't keep up the pretense with me. I'm in no position to be blowing the whistle on any of my fellow sneaksmen. Fine. If you don't want your nature known, so be it. I can't really blame you, what with the Flaming Fist rounding up roustabouts like there was no tomorrow. I know their leader is ill and their second-in-command is dead, but is that any excuse for rough treatment? Perhaps it is, especially since Duke Entar Silvershield was killed.
