Tedious old fellow, isn't he? I suppose I would be, too, if I lived to see as many centuries as he has. But enough talk of the good, <CHARNAME>. I have come to tell of the dark. You have a very special heritage, child, one that graces you with more enemies than friends, I fear. This city holds many secrets and dangers and, as you have rightly come to suspect, the Iron Throne lies somehow at the core of it all. Your investigations will not go unnoticed nor, like as not, unpunished. I urge you to curry the favor of Scar and Duke Eltan, both of the Flaming Fist, as they are good men at heart and capable of providing you with some guidance and protection in this urban vast... But I tarry here too long. It is best we not be seen together.
