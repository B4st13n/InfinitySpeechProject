Lots of people say that. "What do we need guards for?" "What's so special 'bout Tazok's tent?" "Must not be very important if Credus can guard it." Well, they know nothing! Credus guards really well and a good thing too. Not many people know, but Tazok keeps important stuff in there. Papers and things. You just watch your step at night, because I have to thump anyone who comes near. No exceptions. I better go, so you be careful.
