I thank thee for saving me. 'Twas courageous to follow the likes of Minsc into battle, if a touch foolish. I have naught to offer thee in return, save my services in battle. Mayhaps I could travel with thee awhile, and an opportunity may arise for repayment of my debt. Minsc is, well, Minsc, but he hath a strong sword arm, whilst I am practiced in the arcane arts. Shall we join?
