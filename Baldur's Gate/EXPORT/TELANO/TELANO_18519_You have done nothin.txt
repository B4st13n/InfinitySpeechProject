You have done nothing to us directly, but those who harp protect all people of nature good and true. You have committed many vile acts upon the citizens of this land, and have been judged unworthy of the gift of life! I no longer care to observe your mission or destiny! Whether your ultimate fate is for the better or worse, I do not care. Whether the Harper Masters only wish to observe, I do not care! Your evil will end here!
