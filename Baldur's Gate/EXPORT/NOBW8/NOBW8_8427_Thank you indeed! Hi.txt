Thank you indeed! His name is Cyrdemac and he frequents the Elfsong Tavern. I have not been there myself, but I hear it is quite a rough place. You could do the deed in the main bar itself and likely none would call the guards. I know not if he will have friends with him though. Thank you for this. Upon your return I shall pay you 500 gold. A small price to have this embarrassment removed.
