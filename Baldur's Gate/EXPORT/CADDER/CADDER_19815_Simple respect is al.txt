Simple respect is all that it is. Gorion did many good things for many people. When last I spoke with him I was barely acquainted with his fellows myself, but those who harp do tend to keep to themselves their affiliations. He was a longstanding member, from what I understand. Likely he said nothing to you because he wished your childhood to be as normal as possible. I suppose all parents wish this, whether the child is theirs or not. I have yet to meet anyone who made claim to achieving it though. How do you wager you have fared?
