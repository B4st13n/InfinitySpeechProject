This headwoman, Kaishas, had the ship built months ago. She has been waiting for her husband Selaad to return with maps that they may use to return to the mainland. At present, she only knows that it is east. She has gone to the ship that they have built. I have discovered a series of caves, warrens really, that the wolf monstrosities live in. There is a hidden door in this hut. The caves will lead you to the ship. I warn you now: The way is fraught with peril. Head east through the caves and you may find the exit. Hurry friends! I thank you for my freedom. Would that I had the power to help you escape myself. Ah, well, perhaps we shall meet again someday and I will repay you for your assistance.
