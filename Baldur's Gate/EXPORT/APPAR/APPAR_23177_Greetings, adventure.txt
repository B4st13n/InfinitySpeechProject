Greetings, adventurers. So many of you have come down to loot the ancient basements of Durlag, yet none ever return. Adventurers are not known for their wisdom. Otherwise they'd have chosen a safer profession. Take the five people that stand behind me, forever frozen in stone. Each one of these foolish men and women came to find Durlag's treasure. Now they stand vigil over Durlag's bestiary. Most of the other creatures have long disintegrated to dust, but the great wyrm known as Mechezarin still hangs in its original repose of death. Breathtaking, isn't he?
