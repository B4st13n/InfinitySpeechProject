We were the fear made flessssh. We came to the home that Durrrlag built, and we hid in the people that he forrrmed. With tentacles to guide, we poisssoned the clan, and the nightmaresss of Durrrlag came true. Our mastersss said they could tassste his rage even in the air, but alwaysss there was the fear behind. We were the fear made flesssh, but it was already here.
