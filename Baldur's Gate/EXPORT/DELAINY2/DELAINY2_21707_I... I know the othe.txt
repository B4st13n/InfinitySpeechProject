I... I know the others would have you dead, but I'll not raise a claw in your direction. You are just as deserving of life as any other, and I would fight by your side as long as I am able. Follow me, for I know a way out of the village less dangerous. There are warrens beneath the chieftain's hut. Follow and I will lead. That my former friends would attack you shows that they are not who I thought they were, and I feel no shame helping you.
