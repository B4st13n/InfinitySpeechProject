My name is Cyrdemac. At the moment I am blackmailing a woman named Areana. She had a tryst in the Undercellar that she does not want to be public knowledge. You know what I suggest friend? Why don't you go back to Areana, tell her that I'm dead, and then blackmail her with the threat of revealing her murderous inclinations? I'll be alive, and you'll have gold. We'll both win.
