I trust you mean Areana? I would not have thought her capable of hiring someone to kill me, especially of such a trite issue as this. A simple tryst in the Undercellar and she is prepared to pay me for weeks on end. The nobles are such prudes when it comes to one of their number slumming with a common sneaksman. No matter. I will kill you, and then I shall double how much I demand.
