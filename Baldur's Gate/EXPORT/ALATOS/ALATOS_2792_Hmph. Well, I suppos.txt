Hmph. Well, I suppose I should thank you for showing your true nature right away. It saves me the time I'd have spent evaluating you. No need for it now, and no need to ask if you'll take the job. I'll not have you work for me, and you know too much to leave, so I'll just have you killed now. I wish I could say it's been nice. Goodbye.
