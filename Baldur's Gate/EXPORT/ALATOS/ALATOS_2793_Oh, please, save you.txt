Oh, please, save your ingratiating remarks for another time. They are far too good to be wasted on me. In truth, you have never heard of me, and I care not a whit where you go from here. While in this city however, you become my concern. In fact, I should like to take advantage of your talents for a small job, something best accomplished by someone unknown in this city.
