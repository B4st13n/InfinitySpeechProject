You did not complete the mission. Disappointing, to say the least. I am afraid that I don't take too kind a view of failure, and even less so when it means trouble for me as well. I should like you to meet Resar, my Halruaan contact. Not very pleased with any of us, though I have assured him that it is entirely your fault. I believe he would like to have a word with you.
