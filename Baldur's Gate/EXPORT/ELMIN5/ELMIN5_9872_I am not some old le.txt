I am not some old letch that follows thee around for the good of mine eyes, upstart. If I am to be accused of anything, perhaps it is that I have been a touch too mothering. I think this can be excused, however, when compared to the zeal with which thy true parentage pursues thee. I trust thou dost suspect that thou art not "normal."
