Why do you bother? He has abandoned us, and I would not be surprised if he turned us in to the Flaming Fist. He would be a hero yet again. People desperately want a hero, what with Entar Silvershield dead. I would not be surprised if Sarevok was behind it from the start, though he would have to kill the other Grand Dukes if he truly wanted free reign and command. I would not put it past him, though his ultimate goal is beyond me. Seems more interested in carnage than control. Are you through with me? I was in the process of leaving, if you don't mind.
