Heh heh. Sure, sure. Ya see that farm just west of here? That there's ol' man Hendrick's farm. His daughter was a tom-fool tin-head just like you... Died young just this past season, ya hear me? Not long after, a bunch of other tin-heads came lookin' for her, said she had somethin' of theirs. Heh, ol' Hendrick just took 'em outside an' pointed to her grave marker and told 'em to get the hell off his land 'cause they had somethin' of his, too... So that night I heard a ruckus in his henhouse. Looked out the window an' there he was tryin' to stuff somethin' down the gullet of one of them chickens he keeps out back. Draw yer own conclusions, friend, but I'm thinkin' there's somethin' a tin-head like yerself might like buried deep in the gizzard of one of them cluckers, heh heh. Now clear off, afore ya bake in them there ovens of honor ya got on ya.
