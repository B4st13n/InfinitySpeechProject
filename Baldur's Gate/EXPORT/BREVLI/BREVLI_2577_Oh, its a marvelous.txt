Oh, it's a marvelous trinket! A wondrously curious little toy from distant Lantan. What did they call it? Oh, yes, a "telescope," of all things. It's a misleading name for such an interestingly crafted artifact. "Golden Extra-Farseer" would have suited its craftsmanship so much better. There is not another like it this side of the Trackless Sea! Most gnomes have a fixation of sorts, but I don't share the love of gems that possesses my kin. I prefer the feel of metal, and the intricacies of the mechanical. Not that I necessarily understand the function, but it's not right for such an item to be locked away regardless! It was meant to be used and to be held by loving hands, and if those hands just happen to be mine, more the better. The tele-thingy is on display at the Hall of Wonders, and were it in the possession of anyone else it might be purchasable. No doubt you know that the Hall of Wonders is an extension of the High House, the temple to Gond. Being the god of artifice and invention his followers take to revering mechanical devices, and will not part with an original at any price. It's not as though they make proper use of such things! Keeping them behind locked doors where loving hands cannot explore their subtleties. The tele-whatzit was made to be USED, not worshipped! It must be in the hands of someone who can truly appreciate it! Not to be immodest, but that someone is me! I suppose I might buy a replica, but would you wish a copy of a diamond? It's just not the same.
