Poor Brage. It's a pity he could not have been recovered alive. He might yet have come to terms with his actions and repaid the debt he incurred. Now all we can do is say the proper prayers and make sure the way to the next world is well guided. May Helm have pity on his tortured soul. Thank you for bringing his body here. No doubt Oublek would have made much of his death and further despoiled his name. I shall match the bounty you would have received so that you have not risked so much for nothing. The temple is in your debt.
