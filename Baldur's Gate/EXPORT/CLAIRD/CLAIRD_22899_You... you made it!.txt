You... you made it! Dalton ran out faster than I've ever seen him move. Did anyone else... no, they are dead, aren't they? At least Dalton's mother will sleep well tonight. I doubt he'll be going on any more adventures anytime soon. Neither will I, for that matter. At least you stopped the demon knight, though... though it worries me. I have heard that such creatures serve powerful beings even more evil than they, as if such a thing were possible. I... I should go.
