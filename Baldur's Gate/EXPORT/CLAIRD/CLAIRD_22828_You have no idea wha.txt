You have no idea what is ahead, do you? It is a demon knight! A demon knight! Such a thing is as rare as it is evil! Alone it could destroy all of you, but that's only if it decides you are worthy of the effort. My friends went ahead and challenged it like it was some shambling skeleton, and it LAUGHED at them! It didn't even bother to lift its sword!
