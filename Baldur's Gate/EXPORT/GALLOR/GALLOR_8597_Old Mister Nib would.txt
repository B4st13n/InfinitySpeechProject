Old Mister Nib would never admit it, but that is mainly because he doesn't wish to jinx the dig. From what I could decipher in the ancient writings, the final room contains "the plate that provides bounty, leading food unto god." Doesn't take a genius to figure out what that means. Obviously, the item under all that dirt and rubble is enchanted such that it "provides bounty." Whether it's through increased crops or good hunting, I care not. Regardless, an object of that age and enchantment should command a hefty price and I intend to see that it does. You can be a part of it if you wish.
