I am Helshara, a daughter of the great mage Shandalar. My father has given me the duty of selling certain components to the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. They are vital to the construction of a Halruaan flying ship. You could likely do it for me, though. Take my component, if you wish; it is in the desk.
