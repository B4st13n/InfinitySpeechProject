Alas, normally we DO have a substantial number of guards. The majority have been sent east however, to help combat the rash of robberies along the Coastway road. It was after that our own problems began. Two of our remaining guards are among the missing, and Captain himself has not been seen since yesterday last. We have appointed a replacement in his stead, and you may find him about the grounds.
