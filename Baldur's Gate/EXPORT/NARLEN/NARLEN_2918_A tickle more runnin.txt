A tickle more running than I care to do in a dragon's age! Such is the way o' the nightsneak, but not another profession pays as well. Ye be quite the force under the weight o' pursuit, grabbin' the pretties while hoofin' it fast! Ye prove to me an' brethren all that ye be here for good reason. Split the jemmies thrice, and tonight we'll suck the monkey a keg apiece tavern wise!
