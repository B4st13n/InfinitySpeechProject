I am dead regardless. Sarevok left me here for my "failure" earlier. He wished me to dispatch the Grand Dukes rather than effect his escape as I did. He would not consider failing as a possibility: a common weakness in those that would be gods. He will come for me when he realizes his first strike did not kill me. Do as you will: I am resigned to my fate whether it comes now or later.
