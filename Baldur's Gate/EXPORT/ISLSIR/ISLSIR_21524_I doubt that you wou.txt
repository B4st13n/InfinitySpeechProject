I doubt that you would understand. Nevertheless, I will attempt to explain. I am a sirine, and as such must mate with a human male. My song lures them to me and the males are most happy to oblige. Normally, both parties will benefit from the exchange. It is my time to mate so I lured this fisherman to me. He attacked me and tried to force himself upon me. When my song no longer affected him, I took more drastic measures. This monster deserved to die. Perhaps even land-dwellers can understand that.
