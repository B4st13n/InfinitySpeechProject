Now you will belong. It not so bad, and you will begin to feel as we in a short time. It may be... unstable for a time. You may... hurt... but you will live, and we shall all go to new forests and plains with your maps and our ship-home. I will hold the sea charts for now, please you will give. We welcome you to wolfen-kind, and to family you now belong. The beasts you have killed were animal and evil, but we are proper lycantho, and noble in our peace.
