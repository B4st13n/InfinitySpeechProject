Well, sure! My name's Ted, and I'm a big game hunter. Right now, I'm hunting for bear. Ya know a bear's pretty valuable, what with its pelt and meat. Hell! You could even sell its teeth for some sort of profit. Actually, I better get a move on; I don't want to be out after dark, with all those bandits and all.
