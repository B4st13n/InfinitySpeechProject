I can tell you of my curse, for that is all I remember anymore. I used to be beautiful and powerful. An exotic sorceress, with many powers at my command and suitors at my door. But I only had eyes for one man, Jon Irenicus. He was a great and powerful wizard, the only man worthy of my affections, or so I thought. Though I lusted for Jon, he cared little for me, for he had another to whom he was married, Lady Tanova. So I plotted and schemed, and finally came up with a plan to rid the world of Tanova. When the deed was done and Tanova lay dead, I was exultant, but not for long. Jon went mad with fury, and using his powerful magics, divined the identity of his wife's murderer. He arrived at my tower, and I allowed him entry, desirous to finally consummate our love. Jon disabled me with his spells, then he cursed me to this body and set spiders to feed me and keep me alive. So you see, if you were my friend, you would kill me.
