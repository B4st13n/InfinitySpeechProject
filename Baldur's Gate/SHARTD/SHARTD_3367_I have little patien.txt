I have little patience for these paltry pleasantries, but we should know whom we are to fight beside. I am Shar-Teel, and a more competent blade you will not find this side of Waterdeep. I have been paid well to be here, but the sooner we are done, the better. It is likely but a wild dog or some such that plagues these foolish monks. I prefer more challenging circumstances. Life is made fun by crushing your enemies.
