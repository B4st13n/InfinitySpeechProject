So Mulahey's dead, is he? That's good to hear, but, all the same, he's just small time. Even Tazok's not the head honcho in this whole mess. Ardenor Crush and Taurgosz Khosann both think he's getting orders from the Zhents, and Tazok doesn't do much to discourage that particular line of thinking. But Crush and Khosann are bandits, see? They ply the trade routes, avoid the cities, and that's where they go wrong. I'm from the Gate, and I can tell you dead as leather that the Zhentarim aren't behind this.
