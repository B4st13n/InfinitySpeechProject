That's the trick, see? Crush and Taurgosz Khosann, leader of the Blacktalons, both think he's getting orders from the Zhents, and Tazok doesn't do much to discourage that particular line of thinking. But the Blacktalons and Chill are bandit groups, see? They ply the trade routes, avoid the cities, and that's where they go wrong. I'm from the Gate, and I can tell you dead as leather that the Zhentarim aren't behind this.
