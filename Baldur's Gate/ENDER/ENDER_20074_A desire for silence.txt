A desire for silence isn't the only reason I wear soft-soled boots. I wear 'em so I can tell whose toes I'm treading on. I didn't mess with no Zhentarim. I picked my enemies and I messed with one group and one group onlyâ€”the Iron Throne. And, right as rain, here I am as Tazok's personal prisoner. You do the math.
