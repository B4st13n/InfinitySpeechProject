The Throne was dealing in black lotus, slaves, prostitutionâ€”all the vices that King Azoun had a real dislike for. Since the king has the power to do whatever he wants, he banned the Throne from Cormyr. It was a good thing too, otherwise the Throne would have never given Rieltar the funds he needed to start up this operation on the Sword Coast.
