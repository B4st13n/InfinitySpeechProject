Sarevok is whipping the people of this city into a frenzy with his wretched war plans! And no one seems to realize that Amn, the most powerful nation, nay, empire in the hemisphere, would crush us in an instant! I hate myself for it but... but I am so scared for this city. Please, you must investigate the Iron Throne tower further because I know that, despite all your past efforts there, some horror still rests within its walls.
