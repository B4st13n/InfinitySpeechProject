I'm rather ignorant, even for a peasant. Perhaps you don't quite comprehend what I'm telling you; I'm a mental midget, a moron, an idiot. A fruit fly has more intelligence than I do; a brain-damaged ant has more wits than I could ever muster. So I'd have to say using your magics to take control of my mind was a waste of a spell.
