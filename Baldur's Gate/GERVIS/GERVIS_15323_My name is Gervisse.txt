My name is Gervisse and, as you can tell, I am a mage. The two young girls within that fateful room face a dark and uncertain future. They have already come under the eye of a powerful druid who goes by the name of Voltine. She has polymorphed herself, into what I know not, in an effort to infiltrate the house and abduct the twins in the night. Please believe me. Voltine must be found or the twins are in grave danger, indeed.
