I need you to descend into the mines southeast of town, and find out why our miners have been going missing. Hopefully you will also discover why the ore taken from the mine is tainted. Solving these two things won't fix all our problems, but it's the first step to relieving the effects of the iron crisis. Proceed with all possible haste and you will be handsomely rewarded for your efforts. Go now.
