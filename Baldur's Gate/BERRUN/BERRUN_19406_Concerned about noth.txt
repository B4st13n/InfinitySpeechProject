Concerned about nothing but what is in it for you? I should have expected no less. So be it. We need the Nashkel mines secured. Miners are going missing and the ore we do retrieve is tainted somehow. The town guards are busy enough with bandit raids, so we need you to tackle whatever is underground. The town can give you a reward of 900 gold pieces. We are a small community and that is all we can afford. Please, go now and do what you can.
