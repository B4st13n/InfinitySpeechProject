Unacceptable and you well know it. Your companions need to verify what is happening here in Nashkel as much as I do. I need someone to descend into the mines southeast of the town, and find out what is causing our problems. Miners are going missing, and the ore we do retrieve is tainted and useless. You will be rewarded for your efforts. I think you can see the benefits of helping me.
