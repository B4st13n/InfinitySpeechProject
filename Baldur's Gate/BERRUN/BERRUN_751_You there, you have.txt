You there, you have the look of hearty adventuring stock. I am Berrun Ghastkill, mayor of Nashkel. Might I offer you a proposition? I was expecting some people to help with our troubles, but they seem to have forgotten us. If you are up to it, I would ask that you take a look at the mines southeast of town. The miners claim there are demons or some such roaming about, but they are a superstitious lot and prone to exaggeration. I am more concerned with the state of our ore. All iron removed from the mines is tainted somehow, and useless for smithing. I would have you find out how it happens and who is behind it. You will be rewarded handsomely for your efforts.
