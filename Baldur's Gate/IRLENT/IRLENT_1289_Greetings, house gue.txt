Greetings, house guests. I must assume that you are the friends that have had Aldeth so excited. I must introduce myself: I am Irlentree, one of Aldeth's partners in business. I've come to announce that the company is celebrating the anniversary of Aldeth's stay with us. I would like you to join us for the festivities. There should be some interesting surprises.
