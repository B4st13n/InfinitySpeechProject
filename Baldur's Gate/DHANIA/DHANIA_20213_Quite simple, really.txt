Quite simple, really. He has built up support by pledging to combat the very chaos he himself was sowing! I imagine he'll have a fantastic success rate too, seeing as how he is in total control with our leaders dead! I doubt that he will settle into a nice, quiet political life though. He seems set on causing as much destruction as possible, and I think he is intent on pushing for war with Amn!
