The Watchers... Some of the Watchers are so strange now and—and people that I've known and loved for years now pass me in the halls without greeting, without their usual silly story, without some discourse on their latest readings. At first I thought it was me but it's not me, it's them, I see it in their sidelong glance—disdain, jealousy, rivalry, these I could understand, I could make sense of... But they weren't what I saw in their beady eyes: I saw hunger, plain and simple. Now shush, no one must know that I have spoken with you.
