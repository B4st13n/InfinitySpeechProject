So you've killed the Halruaan. Well, don't take it personally that I let him attack you; he was a powerful mage, and there was little I could do to dissuade him from killing you. Don't worry, you have full run of the guildâ€”if you're able to kill a Halruaan mage, I'm sure there's little that my guild members can do to you. Again, accept my apologies for the entire incident.
