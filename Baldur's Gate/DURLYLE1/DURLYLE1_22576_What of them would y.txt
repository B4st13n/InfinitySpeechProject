What of them would you hear? We came to this place long ago on a ship-home, from farther west than the light sets. The explorer chartered with us and we set to the seas. The elders speak of the great storm, though some say the storm came from within. We that belong were to be cast aside, and fought the explorers we did. Much was lost, but this island won. We live alone and are plagued by the beasts, but slaves to none and live as free.
