You may call me Safana if it pleases you. I guess you could say I'm an archeologist, at least I fancy myself one. Along the coast is the burial place of one of my ancestors. I wish to find it in order to learn some of the secrets of my family's past. Recently, I have come across a map that may reveal its location.
