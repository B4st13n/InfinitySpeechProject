I am Dynaheir of Rashemen. 'Tis not a title; 'tis just where I am from. We two are indeed far afield of our home, but 'tis a necessary rite of passage. Minsc must make his dajemma by seeking adventure, while I must prove my worth to my... sisters in much the same manner. 'Tis an interesting time for the realms, with great things foretold for the Sword Coast. 'Tis therefore a likely place to look for what we need. What dost thou seek on this adventurous road? Mayhaps we can all find what we need together?
