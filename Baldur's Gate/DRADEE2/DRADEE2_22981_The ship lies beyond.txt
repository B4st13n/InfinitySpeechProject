The ship lies beyond the mountains to the east. I have discovered a series of caves, warrens really, that the wolf monstrosities live in. There is a hidden door in this hut. The caves will lead you to the ship. I warn you now: The way is fraught with peril. Head east through the caves and you may find the exit. The chieftain's woman is at the boat right now. Hurry, friends! I thank you for my freedom. Would that I had the power to help you escape myself. Ah, well, perhaps we shall meet again someday and I will repay you for your assistance.
