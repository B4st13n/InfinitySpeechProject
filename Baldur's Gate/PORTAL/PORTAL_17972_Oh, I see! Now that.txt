Oh, I see! Now that I've something to say you're all, "please, what do you see?" and "I'm sorry I trod on your begonias." Well, I've better things to do. Suffice to say that you are decidedly shiny on the inside, regardless of your dim exterior. I would imagine that you're not entirely normal, but I didn't need a third eye or fourth leg to tell you that. Now off with you, before I am forced to... well, probably flee.
