There have been a few nameless scullery maids, some new Watchers. As for visitors to the library, though, two men from the Iron Throne arrived, what was it, two days ago? Three? They're here for a meeting with two Knights of the Shield who I believe made their arrival yesterday. Much of their time has been spent on the third floor, arranging preliminaries for the meeting. A man named Koveras has arrived as well but he's mainly kept to himself, researching some of Alaundo's prophecies regarding the Time of Troubles, which we keep on the second floor. Other than that, well... there's only been you.
