*sigh* I am growing old and the young are not so young anymore, nor the carefree so carefree... Alaundo the Seer, the one who founded this fortress of knowledge and whose prophecies I chant each day, he is entombed deep in the bowels of this place... I tell you this, <CHARNAME>, because you're right, it is time you knew. But I beg of you, in Gorion's name, do not venture into those trapped and warded halls unless some higher power than myself bids you go. Your stepfather would never forgive me for your loss... I must go now, childâ€”<CHARNAME>... It is time to chant the Seer's prophecies as I always have.
