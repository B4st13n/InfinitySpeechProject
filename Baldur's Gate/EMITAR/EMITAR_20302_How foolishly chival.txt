How foolishly chivalrous of you, but I can take care of myself, thank you very much. Besides, I have an iron treaty to negotiate with Thaldorn, and the Grand Dukes would hardly be pleased if I abandoned such an important duty for the likes of you, now, would they? If you insist on being as much of a boob and a dimwit as the others, then I shall find the silly stairs on my own.
