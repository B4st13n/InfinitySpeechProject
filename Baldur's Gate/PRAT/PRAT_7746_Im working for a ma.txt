I'm working for a man named Sarevok. He hasn't told me much about all his schemes, but I know he has it in big for you. I helped him frame you for the murders up there in the library. It was a party of doppelgangers that did the deed; they took your forms and then slaughtered those unsuspecting bastards. Nothing much I can do ta help you, but if you want my advice, I'd lay low for a while.
