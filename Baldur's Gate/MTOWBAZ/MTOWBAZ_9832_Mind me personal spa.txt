Mind me personal space! I don't need no strangers getting in me way. Sorry, but I's just a bit edgy these days. Can't blame me though. I don't know what them nobles see in that Sarevok fella, but he's something darker, that's for certain. I know people that used to be with the Iron Throne, and he... did something to them. Something strange. May the gods help us all if he becomes Duke.
