The Iron Throne? Why would you want to know about them fellows? Buncha stiffs, they are. Used to be all stuck up and serious, but at least you could talk to them. Now you couldn't get a reaction out of them if you kicked them in the arse. Something weird in their building, I think. You go funny without enough windows.
