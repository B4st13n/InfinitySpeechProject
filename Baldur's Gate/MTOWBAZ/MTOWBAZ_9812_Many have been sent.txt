Many have been sent out of the city to protect Beregost. I imagine most of the rest will follow, especially once Sarevok declares war on Amn. It will be good to take the fight to their soil for a change. Serves them right for their dishonorable tactics to date. I bet Sarevok doesn't wait long after his coronation to invade. Serves them right!
