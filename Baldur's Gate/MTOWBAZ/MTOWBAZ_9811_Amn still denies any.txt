Amn still denies any wrongdoing, even though Sarevok himself has questioned bandits and they apparently admitted they were Amnian agents. Sarevok has sworn that he will stand firm against Amn, even pursuing war if that is what they wish. If he becomes a Grand Duke, he will have all the influence he needs to launch an attack. I think it's about time we took the fight to them, and Sarevok is the man to lead us.
