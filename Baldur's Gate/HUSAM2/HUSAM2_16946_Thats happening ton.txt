That's happening tonight! If they succeed, Sarevok will have seized control of the entire city. We should move immediately; we have to get to the dukes before it's too late. We must gain entrance to the palace. You can use the invitation you found. The rest of us will see if we can gain access through the sewers of the city. I don't know how successful we'll be, so it's really up to you, <CHARNAME>.
