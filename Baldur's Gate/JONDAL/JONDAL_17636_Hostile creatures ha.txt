Hostile creatures have red circles around their feet. Left-clicking within the circle will direct you to attack me. You can switch weapons using the Quick Weapon icons. The weapon outlined in green is the current weapon. Attack with fists only (empty Quick Slot) if you only wish to knock your opponent unconscious. You don't have to worry about that with me, so use your staff. If you have magical abilities, try casting a spell at me by left-clicking on the spell icon at the bottom of the screen. Left-click on one of the spells that come up and cast it on whichever target you want. I just hope you have an offensive spell memorized.
