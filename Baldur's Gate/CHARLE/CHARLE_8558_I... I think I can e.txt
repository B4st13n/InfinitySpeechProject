I... I think I can explain the madness that overcame my men. They seemed to scream in some ancient tongues, but I recognize the word "Kozah." It's the name of an ancient power, the name of a god of Pandemonium. The tribe that lived here must have worshipped Kozah and the destruction he brought. The artifact that lies within this stone sarcophagus must be what has caused all of this bloodshed. Surely that artifact is cursed beyond belief! We should let it lie within this tomb forever. It's best that it never see the light of day.
