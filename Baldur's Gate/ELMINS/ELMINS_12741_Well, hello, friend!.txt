Well, hello, friend! 'Twould seem thy journeys turned out for the best after all. I would not expect many great accolades for the killing of Sarevok, however. I imagine that the whole incident shall be hushed rather immediately. Rest assured, though, that many of the prominent citizens of the realms know of thy service and are grateful. A friendly word of warning, however. Those same citizens are watching. See that thou dost not pose as much a threat as thy brother did lest another group of young heroes need be dispatched to deal with thee. Luck be with thee.
