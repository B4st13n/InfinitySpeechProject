A mere toy. There is value in the suffering it causes, but you will not have its gift. It is cracked and malfunctions, though it still does a measure of what is intended. I will repair it and await more adventurers who wish to test their resolve. You will have the honor of dying by my very hand, as reward for your unintentional service. You have descended deep and found naught but doom. Such a waste.
