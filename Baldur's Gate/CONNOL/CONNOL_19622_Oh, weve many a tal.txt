Oh, we've many a tale of the Undercellar and those that try to go there unseen. Oft was the time I bumped against a patron so as to "accidentally" drop the hood from their face. More disreputable folk than I have made quite a tidy living soliciting "donations" from those that wished to remain anonymous. I would advise against the practice, however. If they can afford to pay ye, they can also afford to have someone else remove ye.
