I'm glad to hear it. I never took any of you to be the murderin' type. Well then, have you heard all the other rumors flying about the city? Seems that Commander Scar, of the Flaming Fist, has been assassinated. Even worse, Grand Duke Eltan has come down with some sort of magical illness. It was those two who first hired you to save my company from the wretched doppelgangers, so I owe them a lot. Do you think you'd be up to investigate what's wrong with Duke Eltan? I know it'd be tough with you wanted and all, but there's no one else who I think is up to the job.
