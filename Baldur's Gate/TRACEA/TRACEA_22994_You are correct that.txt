You are correct that we shall need powerful allies. How fortunate for us that we are summoning one and will not need you! You would dare suggest that you should be granted immunity from the coming storm, just because you feign loyalty at this moment? We have worshipped for years upon years, and planned for this day to the exclusion of all else! You are but spit in the ocean, and unworthy! Your time is past! Aec'Letec will deliver you from life! The dagger is broken! Witness the new lord arise!
