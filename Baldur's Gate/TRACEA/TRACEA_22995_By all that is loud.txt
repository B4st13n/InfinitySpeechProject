By all that is loud and windy, will you please shut up?! You can pose all you wish, but you have failed! Here will come the new lord, despite your slogans! Here will come the new lord, despite your puny weapons! Here will come the new lord, Aec'Letec! Born of the Abyss, let he who was imprisoned walk the Prime! The dagger is broken! I release you!
