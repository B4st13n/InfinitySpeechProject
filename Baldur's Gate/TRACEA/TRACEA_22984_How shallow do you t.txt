How shallow do you think me that I would give up my destiny after a few short words with you? Have you no strength to YOUR convictions? I have no pity for your kind! You will be swept aside! You are already too late, and a new age rises! Behold Aec'Letec! Born of the Abyss, but destined to walk the Prime! The dagger is broken! Behold your new lord and master!
