Well, bless my soul, you made it back alive! If you don't mind me saying, you're about the most beautiful sight I've seen in weeks! I'll be tellin' the men to get back to work, we've got ore to mine! Still can't ship it for fear of bandits, but that ain't my problem. Best you tell the mayor of what you did here, 'cuz he'll likely give you a reward of some kind.
