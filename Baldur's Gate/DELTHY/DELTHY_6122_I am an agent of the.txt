I am an agent of the Harpers. I was sent to the city of Baldur's Gate to find out what has been happening to you, <CHARNAME>. We know that you have something to do with Alaundo's prophecies on the death of Bhaal. Some of the Harpers feel that you are one of the spawn of Bhaal, which is one of the reasons why I'm down here. I don't think I have any other information for you, my friend.
