Hi. The name's Cordyr. I'm from down south, where the Cloud Peaks tumble into the sea. A pair of sirines has been trying to move into the area. They sank my fishing boat and put me right out of work. *sigh* If they weren't so dang beautiful, it would be a lot easier to convince people of how much of a nuisance they can be.
