I am again in your debt. That creature has kept me helpless for too long. Perhaps if I hadn't been incapacitated, I might have been able to prevent Scar's death. *cough* Angelo will soon hear of my recovery. It is important that you take me away from here; I'm sure Angelo won't want me coherent and among the living. Take me to the Harbor Master's building. The Harbor Master is a good friend of mine. I can rest there until I'm fully recovered. Take this letter; I managed to filch it off Rashad when he was "caring" for me. From what I read of it, it seems that Sarevok has dire plans for the city. I fear for the lives of my fellow Dukes, Liia and Belt. If they were to die, Sarevok would take over the city. You must find Slythe and Krystin, and stop them... *cough* Hurry! We must make haste.
